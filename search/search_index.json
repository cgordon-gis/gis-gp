In this set of exercises you will produce a map of Chancellors Court in the University showing the outlines of the buildings, the paths, and the trees. You will already have a layer from the previous chapter which contains features such as sign posts, benches and rocks. Even if you don\u2019t actually need to digitise a map it is extremely useful to know how to set up your own feature classes and how to add features by editing. Sometimes you just need to outline your study area, or add a point to show where something specific is, or as input to one of the tools provided in Arc. This is a very brief overview of the tools for digitising in QGIS as we are limited for time. Vector and raster If you feel that you are not clear about the difference between raster and vector GIS data it would be worth having a look at the video \u201c Learn more about raster and vector map data \u201d by the Ordnance Survey. As you deal with more GIS data you\u2019ll start to find it easier to spot which formats are raster and which are vector, but you need to be thinking about it already. Obtaining the data You should still have the British National Grid version of the project from the GPS chapter. You will be adding more data to this project. If you no longer have this project you can start a new project from scratch instead, but you won\u2019t have the gps points on the map when you have finished. You will also need to download the DigitiseDataQ.zip file from Minerva unzip the file to the same folder as the Chancellors Court map. You should end up with a folder called getmapping_rgb_25cm which contains aerial imagery of the University 1 . The jpg file contains the image and the other files with it which have a similar name contain information that will locate it correctly within GIS. Open the map project Start by opening the British National Grid version of your Chancellors Court map. (You may need to accept the transform when you do.) From the files you downloaded and unzipped add se2934_rgb_250_01.jpg to your map using the Browser. (You may need to look in sub folders to find the file.) Turn off the waypoints, location and OSM Monochrome layers so they don\u2019t get in the way. You should have an aerial view of Chancellors Court on your map. You will use this as a basis to digitise the buildings, paths and trees. Setting up geopackage feature classes to store your data The first thing you need to do is set up the storage for the data that you are about to create. You already have a GeoPackage in your project, and you will use that to store this new data too. If you don\u2019t already have a geopackage or want to create a new one In the Browser right-click on the folder in which you want to store the new geopackage or geopackage layer. It\u2019s a good idea to use the Project Home folder if you have already saved your map. New > GeoPackage Give your new Geopackage a name in the Database field - don\u2019t delete the path to it, just change the name. If you already have a geopackage (which you should have in this case) In the Browser right-click on the existing geopackage Create a New Layer or Table... You won\u2019t have the choice of changing the geopackage name here For both: Fill in Table name with a name which will remind you what that table contains - in this case call it Buildings Choose a Geometry type - in this case Polygon (note that once this is set for a feature class you can\u2019t change it later) There is a drop down for the CRS (unlabelled) either drop that down and select Project CRS: EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid or use the button at the end of the line to search for the appropriate CRS. If you want to add any fields to contain attributes you can do so now - it is also possible to add fields later Under New Field type in a Name - in this case Label Choose a Type - for this layer choose Text data Then type a Maximum length - for now type in 250 - this is the maximum number of characters your label will be. Then click on the Add to Fields List button to add the new field to the list. You can then add more fields if you need to, but we don\u2019t at the moment. Once you\u2019ve added all of the fields click on OK to create the new feature class. The new feature class should be created in your GeoPackage and added to your map. If it isn\u2019t added to your map drag it there from the Browser now. Creating two more feature classes Use the same instructions to create two further feature classes in the same geopackage. Note that the Geometry type is different this time and remember that you must set these correctly or you have to create the feature classes again. Create a Line feature class called Paths . This doesn\u2019t need any new fields. Create a Point feature class called Trees . Again, this doesn\u2019t need any new fields. Have a look at the new layers in your geopackage using the Browser. Note that the icons next to the layers show you what the Geometry type is. Digitising in QGIS You should already have an aerial view as a background for your map. For these exercises you be digitising polygons, lines and points by tracing over features on this view. Before starting to digitise check that you have the Digitising Toolbar open. View > Toolbars Check that there is a tick next to Digitising Toolbar The toolbar should look something like this image at the moment. The only button available is Toggle Editing . Digitising polygons The Buildings feature class has a geometry type of Polygon , so this will hold closed shapes. We\u2019ll start by digitising polygons, but lines and points are actually very similar. Start by selecting the Buildings layer in the Layers panel Either right-click on the layer and click on Toggle Editing or click the Toggle Editing button on the Digitising toolbar. You should have more buttons available on the Digitising toolbar now. The button that I\u2019ve highlighted is Add Polygon Feature . Click on this so that you are ready to start tracing. We\u2019ll digitise the School of Earth and Environment (SEE) building by drawing around the outline on the aerial photograph. SEE is the building to the north of Chancellors Court 2 . Left-click on one corner of the SEE building, then on the next. Keep left-clicking until you have outlined the building. You can zoom in and out and pan as necessary (to pan easily hold down the mouse wheel and drag the map). Each click creates a vertex or node. If you want to delete the previous vertex that you placed because it\u2019s not right just press the Delete or Backspace keys on your keyboard. If you\u2019re not happy with the whole shape clicking on Esc will get rid of it completely. When you have placed a vertex on each corner of the building right-click to finish editing. Depending on the settings in your installation of QGIS you should find that a Features Attributes window opens. This gives you an opportunity to add attributes to your table. The buildings feature class has a Label attribute. Fill that in now with the name of the building - School of Earth and Environment . The fid (or Feature ID) is generated automatically so don\u2019t touch that. Click OK . To save your new feature to the geopackage make sure that you click on the Save Layer Edits button on the Digitising toolbar Your new feature should appear as a solid colour on your map. Continue on to digitise the buildings to the east, west and south of Chancellors Court. The map below shows the names of the buildings for you to add. When you have finished digitising and have saved your edits click on the Toggle Editing button again to finish. Styling your layer The previous chapter gave you instructions for styling your point layer . Use those instructions again to style your layer in a way that you think is suitable for your data. For example buildings are often styled as a pale brown colour. The original instructions apply to point symbols, polygons and lines are styled in a very similar way, so just have a go and see what you come up with. Transparency It can be useful to make your layers transparent . As you draw your building polygons you\u2019ll gradually be covering up the layers underneath and it can be useful to see through the top layers. Click on the Buildings layer in the Layers pane Then click on the button at top left of the Layers pane to Open the Layer Styling Panel The layer styling panel should open to the right of your map. Click on the Symbology tab on the left then go down to the Layer Rendering heading and drop it down using the little black arrow on the left. Use the Opacity slider to change the opacity or transparency of your layer. For example, slide it to about 70% Set the opacity so that you can see through your building polgons to the aerial imagery below. Data quality Think about data quality issues Stop and think about the digitising you have just done. Can you think of any potential issues with the data that you have created in this way? What scale did you digitise at? What effect will this have on the amount of detail that you included? What recommendation would you make about viewing the data on the map? How accurate were you when you were placing the vertices on the corners of the buildings? How clear were the edges of the building that you were digitising? What did you do when the edges were unclear, e.g. because of overlapping trees. What about shadows? Editing features If you want to edit a polygon or line to change it once you have created it you can. Click Toggle Edit on the toolbar (if you aren\u2019t already editing) Click on the Vertex tool on the digitising toolbar. Then right-click on the feature that you want to edit. The feature\u2019s vertices will become visible as small red circles or squares. Left-click on one of the vertices and you will be able to move it around. When the vertex is in the position that you want it just left-click again. When you\u2019ve finished editing right-click on the feature again to stop using the vertex tool. Don\u2019t forget to click on Save Layer Edits When you have done all of your edits click Toggle Edit again to stop editing. Deleting features If you want to delete a feature completely you can. Click Toggle Edit on the toolbar (if you aren\u2019t already editing) Look for Select Features by area or single click button on the toolbars (highlighted on the image of the Attributes toolbar below) Click on the feature that you want to delete - it should become highlighted in bright yellow Press Delete on your keyboard Don\u2019t forget to click on Save Layer Edits When you have done all of your edits click Toggle Edit again to stop editing. Labelling features As you added features to your feature class you also added the Label attribute. You can now use this to label the features on your map. Click on the Buildings layer in the Layers pane Then click on the button at top left of the Layers pane to Open the Layer Styling Panel if it isn\u2019t already open. The layer styling panel should open to the right of your map. Click on the Label tab on the left. At the moment it will just say No labels . Drop down where it says No labels and select Single labels At this stage QGIS usually just labels your features with the first field in the feature class, which at the moment is fid . This isn\u2019t very useful so the first thing you need to do is select the correct field. Next to Value drop down the choices and select the Label field. Immediately the building names that you added should appear on your map on top of the correct buildings. The default fonts, colours and placements are not always what you want. In fact, usually just accepting the defaults is not a good idea. Use the settings on the first of the tabs (Text) to change the font, font size and colour Click on the Placement tab and click on the button next to Horizontal (slow) . This should move your labels within the polygon shapes. Feel free to try out the properties in the other tabs too. There are lots of choices to help you make your labels clear and informative. Digitising Line features Digitising line features is very similar to digitising polygons, except that you don\u2019t have to finish where you started. You should already have a Paths layer in your Layer panel. If you haven\u2019t then drag it across from the geopackage. Some of the paths on this map are curved rather than straight. The easiest way of drawing curved lines in QGIS is to click more often. On tight curves you do have to click a lot to make the line look curved. There are more advanced editing tools which would help, but this is only a quick overview so you can explore them if you want to, but this way of drawing is fine for now. Select the Paths layer, toggle editing and click on the Add line feature button Add lines for the paths across Chancellors Court. You don\u2019t need to add any labels for this layer. Save your edits and toggle editing off. Think about data quality Again, think about the problems that you encounter as you edit. Do you draw the edges of the paths, or just the centre line? How can you be sure of what happens underneath trees? How easy is it to be accurate with the drawing tools? Think about the implications for future use of the map at different scales. Digitising Point features Digitising point features is very similar to digitising polygons, except that you only have to click once for each point. You should already have a Trees layer in your Layer panel. If you haven\u2019t then drag it across from the geopackage. Select the Trees layer, toggle editing and click on the Add point feature button Add a point for each tree in Chancellors Court. You don\u2019t need to add any labels for this layer. Save your edits and toggle editing off. Think about data quality Again, think about the problems that you encounter as you edit. How easy is it to decide where you should add a point to represent a tree? How easy is it to be accurate with the drawing tools? Think about the implications for future use of the map at different scales. Finally Finish digitising the buildings around Chancellors Court, the paths across it, and the trees. Check that all of the layers that you have created - the points, lines and polygons, have been symbolised appropriately and are labelled where necesary. Turn off the Aerial image by unticking the box next to it in the Layers panel If you want to, turn the symbolised waypoints layer back on Make sure that all of the features on your digitised layers are visible in the map window. You should export your map from QGIS as an image and upload it to your GIS Portfolio. If you upload it within a week of the class I will give you feedback on your work. When you are happy with your map go to Project > Import / Export > Export Map to Image In the Save Map as Image dialog set the extent by clicking on the Map Canvas Extent button Click on Save In a later chapter you\u2019ll find out how to create a full map layout with a key, scale bar, measured grid etc and print or export that properly, but for now this is fine and will enable me to give you feedback on your use of the tools you\u2019ve been introduced to today. In the next chapter you\u2019ll be working on the North Wales map and you won\u2019t need this Chancellors Court map again. Further information and suggested reading Many of the books in the reading list 3 have a general introduction to GIS which explain what it is and how it is used. Suggestions include the following: Chapter 5, Data input and editing in Heywood, I., Cornelius, S. and Carver, S. (2011), pp.135-173 covers the background to a variety of ways of inputting data to GIS and discusses data quality issues. Chapter 8, Data Collection in Longley, P.A. et al. (2015), pp.173 onwards. Again this chapter covers the background to a variety of ways of collecting data and inputting it to GIS. Section 8.3.2 from page 183 covers Vector Data Capture, or digitising. The QGIS Documentation has a chapter on the techniques of Editing which covers much more than we have been able to cover here. The information about Digitising an existing layer covers the topics in this chapter, but there is plenty more there. Digitising an existing layer for v. 3.10 of QGIS Digitising an existing layer for v. 3.16 of QGIS There are a lot of videos on YouTube which may help you. Try searching for Digitising QGIS . This data was downloaded from Aerial Digimap. \u21a9 If you\u2019ve lost Chancellors Court in your map remember that you have the LocationBNG layer in your map from the previous chapter. You can Zoom to Layer on that to get back to the right area. \u21a9 The reading list is available in Minerva and from the library (search for the number of this module). \u21a9","title":"Creating data by digitising"},{"location":"creating_data/#creating-data-by-digitising","text":"The background to data for GIS will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

It\u2019s a good idea to use the Project Home folder if you have already saved your map. New > GeoPackage Give your new Geopackage a name in the Database field - don\u2019t delete the path to it, just change the name. If you already have a geopackage (which you should have in this case) In the Browser right-click on the existing geopackage Create a New Layer or Table... You won\u2019t have the choice of changing the geopackage name here For both: Fill in Table name with a name which will remind you what that table contains - in this case call it Buildings Choose a Geometry type - in this case Polygon (note that once this is set for a feature class you can\u2019t change it later) There is a drop down for the CRS (unlabelled) either drop that down and select Project CRS: EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid or use the button at the end of the line to search for the appropriate CRS. If you want to add any fields to contain attributes you can do so now - it is also possible to add fields later Under New Field type in a Name - in this case Label Choose a Type - for this layer choose Text data Then type a Maximum length - for now type in 250 - this is the maximum number of characters your label will be. Then click on the Add to Fields List button to add the new field to the list. You can then add more fields if you need to, but we don\u2019t at the moment. Once you\u2019ve added all of the fields click on OK to create the new feature class. The new feature class should be created in your GeoPackage and added to your map. If it isn\u2019t added to your map drag it there from the Browser now. Creating two more feature classes Use the same instructions to create two further feature classes in the same geopackage. Note that the Geometry type is different this time and remember that you must set these correctly or you have to create the feature classes again. Create a Line feature class called Paths . This doesn\u2019t need any new fields. Create a Point feature class called Trees . Again, this doesn\u2019t need any new fields. Have a look at the new layers in your geopackage using the Browser.

Again this chapter covers the background to a variety of ways of collecting data and inputting it to GIS. Section 8.3.2 from page 183 covers Vector Data Capture, or digitising. The QGIS Documentation has a chapter on the techniques of Editing which covers much more than we have been able to cover here.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate that you can find suitable data for GIS projects from a variety of sources describe the main types of data used in GIS acknowledge the data that you use in your maps in a suitable fashion Introduction Being able to find, download and prepare your own data is an essential part of using GIS. While the data will be provided for you for many of the exercises in this module, you will find it useful to have some idea of where the data comes from, and what there is available for you to use for your own maps. While downloading shouldn\u2019t take too long, don\u2019t leave it until the last minute before you have to produce a map. Websites can become unavailable either permanently or temporarily, or computers can crash. Digimap Digimap is a service provided to Higher Education in the U.K. by EDINA at Edinburgh University. Digimap provides a front end to digital maps and data of Great Britain from the Ordnance Survey and British Geological Survey, amongst others. The University of Leeds subscribes to the collections and as a student you have access to maps and data for use as part of your studies. Logging in to Digimap If you have not used Digimap before you will need to register and log in using your University ID, that is the username and password that you use to access University systems such as Minerva. Full instructions for logging in are on the Digimap help pages . Go to the Digimap Collections page at https://digimap.edina.ac.uk Click the Log in button at the top right of the screen type Leeds in the box and select University of Leeds from the list of available institutions You should get the familiar University of Leeds log in page, so type your University username and password into the appropriate boxes and then click the Log in button. If you are already logged in to Minerva you may find that you don\u2019t have to enter your login details again. If this is the first time that you\u2019ve logged in to Digimap you\u2019ll be asked to register for each collection separately, though you can do all at one go. You won\u2019t need to use all of the collections during this module, but it\u2019s worth registering for all that are available to you so that you can explore them for yourself. The University does not subscribe to Marine or Global Digimap. Go through the list of collections, read and accept the conditions for each one, selecting Academic Works (coursework, projects, dissertations etc.) in the Purpose dropdown for each. Once you submit all of those you should be taken to the Digimap initial page again, as shown below, but this time you should see your name at top right rather than the log in button. The list includes options for a large number of collections. In this workbook we\u2019ll only be looking at the collections that are the most relevant for creating the maps you\u2019ll need during your course, but if you are interested in any of the others feel free to explore them. EDINA have worked to make all of the tools similar across each collection, so just have a go! Browsing maps on screen Each Digimap collection provides a Roam and a Download interface. The Roam interface allows you to view the data from that collection on a map on screen. Using Digimap OS Roam As an example click on Ordnance Survey on the menu at the top of the main screen Then select Roam under View, annotate & print a map on the right. Have a go at zooming in and out and exploring the map at different scales. Try searching for a location in the Search box at the top left. In this module we\u2019ll be making most use of the Download interface, but it\u2019s worth knowing what the Roam interface will do too, so have a quick go with a few of the tools on the left before continuing with the next exercise. If you want more information about using the Roam interface have a look at the Digimap Resource Centre which is linked from Resources on the main page. Downloading data from Digimap Data Download is the tool for downloading data for use in GIS or CAD software. The format that the data is delivered in will determine whether you will be able to open it directly in a software package or whether you will need to convert it. We\u2019ll be using data from Digimap in QGIS for various exercises in the rest of this module, so you need to know your way around this section. Instructions for converting, importing and viewing file types that need it will be given later in the workbook. As an example of the download interface we\u2019ll download some Ordnance Survey data. Start from the Digimap main page (you can get back to it by clicking on the icon at the top right of the map - hover over to see a tool tip) click on Ordnance Survey in the menu at the top of the page from the Ordnance Survey page choose Data Download Data Download takes you to a map that looks very similar to Digimap Roam, but with some important differences. Selecting an area On the left there is a menu panel with options for selecting an area, with a search box above it. Click in the Search box and type Otley , then press Enter or click on the magnifying glass to search When you get the results click on Otley (Leeds) to zoom in, then close the search results Under Draw click on the rectangle and use the mouse to draw a box around the area shown by an orange box in the image below, clicking to start and finish the box. It doesn\u2019t matter if the box you draw is a bit bigger, but try not to make it any smaller. Area view Note that the map you see on the screen only shows the area that you will be downloading data for, not the actual data that you\u2019ll be downloading. You\u2019ll select the data in the next section so don\u2019t worry what it looks like for now. Selecting data sets Now that you have selected an area you have to select the data that you need. Back in the panel on the left, under Select Data Products , drop down each of the headings, e.g. Backdrop Mapping, in turn by clicking on the arrow next to them. There are a lot of different data sets here and most of them won\u2019t mean anything to you. For now select the following data sets when you find them, by putting a tick in the box next to them. Backdrop mapping: VectorMap Local Raster Land and Height data: OS Terrain 5 Contours You can get more information about the data sets by clicking on the arrow next to them. This includes information on licences - which you will need to know later. The number on the right in brackets under Order Size shows how many tiles your selected area uses out of the maximum downloadable number. If you have chosen a slightly different area to me your number may be different but you should still be well within the limit. When you have selected the data you require click on Add to Basket (Don\u2019t worry, despite the Basket and Checkout you won\u2019t be charged. The University has already paid the subscription.) Your basket should appear with details of your order. Some datasets will give you an option to change the format. In this case click on Select Format next to the OS Terrain 5 Contours. The choices are Shape, GML3 or DWG . Choose Shape in this case. You may also need to select a theme. For the VectorMap Local Raster there is a choice of themes - pick Black and white for this exercise, though it is worth downloading the others to have a look at them too. Some items will have a Clip option. This means that the data will be sent to you clipped to the area outline that you requested. If you are short of disk space this is very useful as it restricts the amount of data you need to download, but otherwise it doesn\u2019t hurt to have extra data around the outside of your study area. I prefer to untick this box and download full map tiles. Give the order a name, e.g. OtleyOS (for Ordnance Survey). This will be part of the file name of the zip file that you download, so try to make it short but helpful! Click on Request Download Downloading your data. You\u2019ll receive an email confirming your order, then another with a download link. This can sometimes take a while to arrive, depending on how busy the service is. Make sure that you are still logged in to Digimap before you click on the download link. Once you have clicked on the link a browser window should open telling you that your order is ready to download. Click on Download You\u2019ll download a zip file. NOTE: Don\u2019t run or open the file directly from your browser, and make sure that you DON\u2019T save your zip file to a temp folder where you will probably be unable to unzip it. Warning Make sure that you remember where you have saved the zip file. Now open File Explorer (in Windows) and navigate to the location where you saved the zip file. Right-click on the compressed map data file that downloaded and choose to Extract files... - or 7-zip > Extract files... if you have 7-zip available. Select where you want to save the extracted files, and make a note of where you save them to You should end up with a folder for each dataset that you requested plus text files showing citations and contents. The folders will also have the order number as part of their name. Viewing your data In this case the files that you have downloaded are either tiff graphics files or shapefiles. Navigate to the data that you downloaded in the file explorer and find the folder called something like vml-raster_bwr_3612556 (your order number will be different). you\u2019ll also need to go into a folder with the OS grid letters - in this case for Otley it should be se Open one of the .tif files by double-clicking on it - the file should open in a graphics program, but that depends what you have set up on your computer. Don\u2019t worry if it doesn\u2019t! You should be able to see that this is basically a \u201cpicture\u201d of a map. Try opening one of the .shp files from the terrain-5_3612555 folder too. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to. Just cancel that and don\u2019t try finding software that will open it! Warning Both folders will contain files that have similar names to the .shp and .tif files, but different file extensions. These won\u2019t open in any programme but are essential for using the data in GIS programs such as QGIS, so make sure that you always keep these files together. Both of these formats will open in QGIS in the same way that you added data to your map in the Introduction to GIS . You don\u2019t need to keep the files that you have just downloaded. Copyright acknowledgements for Digimap data Copyright is important. Remember that most data providers ask you to sign up to conditions that include an obligation to add a copyright acknowledgement to your map. Check what that copyright statement is and add it. When you signed up to use the Digimap collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. The wording does change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check it for yourself. To find these copyright acknowledgements: go back to the main Digimap home page go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements under Popular Resources and click on it Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used - in this case the Ordnance Survey Collection You may need to download a pdf file rather than see it on a web page - do so and then open the pdf. then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text. For example, as of August 2020 when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your maps. \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Adding the copyright symbol to your text To add the copyright symbol - \u00a9 - to your text check that the Num lock is on on the keyboard hold down the Alt key on the keyboard then use the number pad to type 0169 release the Alt key Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when you registered. If you are not using U.K. Ordnance Survey data this is not the correct copyright acknowledgement to use. For example, if you are using data for Spain or the United States, or indeed UK data that you haven\u2019t downloaded from Digimap. You\u2019ll need to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for yourself. Advice on citing Digimap data , as opposed to the copyright acknowledgement is given in the Digimap Resource Centre. The GIS Lounge page on How to cite GIS materials gives some information about citing the software as well as the data. Have a look at that and follow the suggestions to cite non-Digimap data. Other Digimap collections In addition to Ordnance Survey Digimap you will also find that you\u2019ll make use of some of the other collections, in particular Geology Digimap and Aerial Digimap . The Roam and Download interfaces work in a very similar way to the Ordnance Survey collection so you should find that you already know how to use them. You\u2019ll be downloading BGS data from Digimap and adding it to your map of the Llanbedr area later in the course. You have access to all of these collections so feel free to have a look at what is available and make use of any of the data or maps in your work. Exploring other Digimap collections Go into the Historic Digimap Collection and use Historic Roam to look up either your house or the University using old maps. Try the 2 up view to see how you can compare old and new mapping of the same area. Digimap Collections online help Digimap help is available from each of the collection pages. Click on the links in the left-hand menu for more information about how to use the services and file formats. Alternatively use the Help links from within Roam or Download or use the videos that EDINA have uploaded to YouTube If you want more detailed information EDINA provide e-learning units which are linked from the main Digimap home page . Data from the web EDINA Digimap provides a wide range of useful data covering the UK, but you are also likely to need data from outwith the UK, or UK data that isn\u2019t provided by Digimap. It isn\u2019t possible to cover everything in this session, but I will show you one particular source which you should find useful. Natural Earth Data Natural Earth is a free, public domain dataset consisting of raster and vector data that will allow you to make maps at general scales. If you want a map of the World, or a general map of a particular country, this is a good starting point. Start by going to Natural Earth in your browser The front page gives an overview of the principles behind the data and an idea of the scales at which it is available. You can find more information under the Features tab, including the file formats and the coordinate system - both important for using the data within GIS. Natural Earth data Go to the Features page and make a note of the file types of both the raster and vector data provided by Natural Earth and of the coordinate system that the data comes in. To download data either Click the Get the Data green button on the front page or click on the Downloads tab at the top of the site Choose the scale that you want to download and the type of data that you want, e.g. cultural, physical or raster For this exercise download the following data: Medium scale data, 1:50m > Cultural > Admin 0 - Countries - click on the Download countries button to download a zip file. Make a note of where this file is saved to on your disk. Medium scale data, 1:50m > Raster > Natural Earth 1 - click the Download small size button under Natural Earth 1 with Shaded Relief and Water . Again, make a note of where the zip file is saved. Keep these data layers for later exercises. If you are working on a University computer you will need to make sure that the files are within your own disk space, either on your M: drive, or a USB drive. If you are working on the VWD make sure that you save the data to your network (M:/ drive). Have a look at the summary of the data on the Features page. If you wish try downloading other datasets. You can try adding them to a blank map in QGIS in the same way that you added data in the Introduction to GIS. Natural Earth data copyright Finding and acknowledging the copyright of data is very important. Return to the Natural Earth front page Look at the text in the box next to the Get the Data button. One of the links there is to the Terms of Use page. Click on that now. Acknowledging Natural Earth data Read the Terms of Use of Natural Earth data How should you acknowledge the Natural Earth data if you use it in one of your maps? The terms of use do say that \u201cCrediting the authors is unnecessary\u201d, however, it is still a good idea to add the data acknowledgement to your map to avoid any possibility of plagiarism. You can choose whether to use the short or long text listed on the page. Adding the url of the data can also be a very good idea. Finding other data online These are just a few examples of finding useful data for GIS. Through out the rest of the workbook you\u2019ll be downloading your own data from Digimap. If you need data from elsewhere I\u2019ll either give full instructions or provide the data for you, but tell you where I got it from. If you are looking for data for a particular project it is well worth searching online using your favourite search engine (e.g. Google). Put the words \u201cgis\u201d and \u201cdata\u201d into your searches and it should help you to find relevant data.

Remember that most data providers ask you to sign up to conditions that include an obligation to add a copyright acknowledgement to your map. Check what that copyright statement is and add it. When you signed up to use the Digimap collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. The wording does change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check it for yourself. To find these copyright acknowledgements: go back to the main Digimap home page go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements under Popular Resources and click on it Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used - in this case the Ordnance Survey Collection You may need to download a pdf file rather than see it on a web page - do so and then open the pdf. then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text. For example, as of August 2020 when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your maps. \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Adding the copyright symbol to your text To add the copyright symbol - \u00a9 - to your text check that the Num lock is on on the keyboard hold down the Alt key on the keyboard then use the number pad to type 0169 release the Alt key Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when you registered.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to Explain what a geopackage consists of and why it is used to store GIS data understand how you can collect your own spatial data for use in GIS explain how to symbolise data on a map so that it displays clearly and informatively to your audience Introduction The previous chapter should have given you some idea of the variety of data that is available for you to use, but there is nothing to replace going out and collecting your own data and it is very likely that you will be using GPS units for fieldwork at some point. If you are new to GPS and would like to find out more about the background and technology there is a beginners guide at: Garmin Collecting data with a GPS unit Unfortunately this year (2020) it isn\u2019t possible for us to go out onto campus as a group and collect waypoints with a GPS unit so I will provide the data for you. If you have access to a GPS unit you could go outside on your own and collect waypoints . Note that this exercise doesn\u2019t make use of tracks or routes. You should then download a .gpx file from your GPS and follow the instructions in the rest of this chapter. Data to download Download the file GPS_dataCC.zip from the Week 8 folder in Minerva Save the file to your disk and unzip it The zip file should contain the following items a folder called mastermap several files which make up a single shapefile called LocationBNG.shp - make sure that you keep all of these files together Waypoints_26-FEB-14.gpx - waypoints which I collected back in 2014 and luckily still have. This is the file downloaded from gps unit. Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf - a map showing the location and type of all of the waypoints that I collected. Starting a new project in QGIS You can just open QGIS and start adding data, but it will help you later if you take more care at this stage. Open QGIS Go to Project > Save and navigate to the folder in which you would like to save your project. This could be a folder called gis with a subfolder called ChancellorsCourt - note that there should not be any spaces in the folder name. Give your project a name, e.g. ChanCourt - short and no spaces. Save Having done that you should have a file in your folder called ChanCourt.qgz . Go to Project > Properties in the menu in QGIS and click on the General heading on the left The Project file should already be filled in Set Project home to the folder in which you saved the qgz file Set the Project title to something like Chancellors Court, University of Leeds - basically a description of what your map is going to show. Check that Save paths is set to relative Click OK Save paths is probably the most important project setting as it can save you from having data go missing if you move your project to another computer. By setting this to relative , as long as you move the whole folder, your data and your map will stay linked. Using the Browser to find information about a layer Now that you have the Project home set it is possible to use that heading in the Browser to find everything associated with this project (assuming all of your files are in that folder). Go to the Browser (if it isn\u2019t already open go to View > Panels and put a tick next to Browser ). Click on the little arrow next to Project Home to see the contents of the folder. You should see all of the files that you unzipped earlier. One of the benefits of the browser is being able to have a look at the details of your data before you add it to a map. If you are in version 3.16 or above of QGIS click on the little arrow next to Waypoints_26-FEB-14.gpx You should see that the file includes several layers . For this exercise the only one we want is waypoints Right-click on the waypoints layer and go to Layer Properties If you are in version 3.10 of QGIS Right-click on the Waypoints_26-FEB-14.gpx layer and go to Layer Properties In both versions Use the three tabs at the top of the layer properties - Metadata 1 , Preview and Attributes - to have a look at your file. The Metadata tab tells you quite a lot, but the preview tab can confirm that your data looks correct, and the Attributes tab will let you see the table of data that you have. Make a note of the CRS One particularly important piece of information is the CRS, or Coordinate Reference System. You\u2019ll need to know this later. Make a note of the text next to the CRS subheading in the Metadata then close the Layer Properties. Adding a gpx layer to a map This is slightly different in the older and newer versions of QGIS. In version 3.16: Drag and drop the waypoints layer from the Browser to the Layers panel. In version 3.10: Double-click on `Waypoints_26-FEB-14.gpx\u2019 in the Browser In the Select Vector Layers to Add dialog select waypoints Click on OK In both versions You should now have a map showing small circles for each of the waypoints which looks something like the image below. (Your colours may be different.) Exporting gpx layer to a geopackage As they are at the moment, this is not a proper GIS layer. If you are going to use these points for further analysis you need to export them to a GIS format, such as a layer in a Geopackage . Geopackage format A geopackage is a form of database designed to store spatial data. It has been relatively recently developed but it\u2019s use as a GIS format has spread very quickly. QGIS encourages the use of geopackages and it is increasingly possible to use them in other GIS software. You will store vector data in a geopackage as multiple layers. If you want more information about the format there is a lot on the GeoPackage website . To export the waypoints to a geopackage layer: In the Layers panel right-click on the waypoints layer Export > Save Features As... Fill in the panel that opens as follows: Format = GeoPackage Click on the ... button at the end of the File name box, navigate to the folder in which you want to store your geopackage - preferably the same folder as your .qgz file, then give your geopackage a name, e.g. University.gpkg . The location tends to be a good idea here. Save In the Layer name box give your layer a name such as Waypoints - it needs to be a name that will tell you what data this layer contains. Check that the CRS field is the same as the CRS you made a note of earlier - in this case that should be EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 Check the bottom of the form to make sure that Add saved file to map is ticked. Click OK to create the geopackage and add the new layer to your map. Your map won\u2019t look much different, though the dots may have changed colour. To keep the Layers panel tidy right click on the original waypoints layer and Remove layer... Installing QGIS plugin to display a background map At the moment you have your waypoints on a map, but can\u2019t check where they are located. One of the strengths of QGIS is that it has a wide variety of plugins that you can install to carry out extra tasks. One of these plugins allows you to add maps from the web as background maps so we\u2019ll install that now. In the menu go to Plugins > Manage And Install Plugins... To install a new plugin: Click on Not installed on the left Type QuickMapServices into the search box at the top From the list that appears click on QuickMapServices and have a look at the description This plugin will do what you want it to do so click on Install Plugin Once it has installed you should get a message at the top telling you it has been successful and QuickMap Services should now be in the list of Installed plugins. You can Close the plugin manager now. Once the plugin is installed you will have new menu items and toolbar buttons available to you. On the menu go to Web > QuickMapServices . You should have a very long list of choices available. Go to OSM > OSM Standard . OSM stands for OpenStreetMap which is a crowd-sourced map of the World. It can be very useful for quick maps, but isn\u2019t always completely reliable and some areas don\u2019t have much data. Now that you\u2019ve added the OSM Standard basemap you should be able to see the details of Chancellors Court at the University with your waypoints shown on top. If you can\u2019t see your waypoints check that they are above the basemap in the Layers pane. Zoom to 1:500 to see the buildings around Chancellors Court too. Other QuickMapServices basemaps Have a look at some of the other basemaps from QuickMapServices. Not all will cover this area, and some need a licence key, but there are plenty of choices. You will need to switch off other basemaps in the Layers when you add new ones so that you can see them. For example, try Bing Map Bing Satellite OSM Cycle map OSM monochrome Finish with the OSM monochrome basemap on your map with all of the other basemap layers removed. The monochrome (black and white) background map will make your data easier to see. Adding extra data to feature classes The layer that you have saved to a Geopackage is known in GIS terms as a feature class . This contains your features and data for each one which are called attributes . In the Layers panel right-click on your waypoints layer and select Open Attribute Table . The attribute table is the GIS equivalent of a spreadsheet and contains features and their attributes. Amongst many other attributes there should be one for name which should include the label or name of each waypoint as stored by the GPS unit. In this case the name field holds a number which matches the numbers of the points on the Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf file which you downloaded from Minerva. Open the file Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf from the downloaded data and have a look at the information there Labels on the map show the name field followed by a description of the type of feature, e.g. Rock, Sign post, Planter. Somehow we need to get that extra information in to the attribute table and unfortunately that has to be done manually! Have another look at the waypoints attribute table. There is a field there called desc for description. This seems to be a sensible field in which to put the new information. To start adding attributes to a table you need to start editing the feature class. On the attribute table window click on the Toggle Editing Mode button at top right (see the annotated picture of the attribute table above, and remember that tool tips are visible if you hover over buttons). Click in the space under desc for the point with the name 001 - the word NULL should be selected Look at the pdf map and find point 001 (it\u2019s top left of Chancellors Court) - what is the description of it? If you have trouble finding it try selecting the feature in the attribute table by clicking on the number in the grey space on the left. The point will then be highlighted on your map in QGIS The description for point 001 should be Sign post so type that in to the attribute table. Click on the Save edits button on the attribute table toolbar to write your edits to the feature class in the geopackage. Continue doing this for some more of the points. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find some of them on the map - just leave those blank (NULL). Try to do a minimum of about 20 of the points. There are rather a lot there and you don\u2019t need to do all of them on this occasion! Once you\u2019ve input the descriptions (and saved your edits) click on the Toggle Editing Mode button again to stop editing then close the attribute table by clicking on the cross in the top right. Styling the point layer Now that you have the description in your attribute table you can style your point layer. Styling a layer as a single symbol The default styling is for single symbols. Select the waypoints layer in the Layers panel and click on the Open the Layer Styling panel button - at the top of the Layers panel on the left. This should open on the right of the map window and gives you choices for the way your layer looks. In this view you can click on any of the symbols in the gallery and the symbols on your map will change to match them. Try this now. The section at the top allows you to change the size, opacity and colour of the symbols. Again, try changing the choices there and see what they do. Styling a layer as categories So far you have a single coloured symbol representing every point. Your map would be much more informative if each type of feature had it\u2019s own symbol. At the top of the Layer Styling panel click on the dropdown that says Single symbol and change it to Categorized Now drop down the list next to Value and select the field that you want to categorize your symbols on - in this case desc Lower down the panel click on the button that says Classify Your descriptions should appear as a list and the symbols on your map should change to a variety of random colours. Note that the attributes that you left as NULL in the attribute table have all been styled as a symbol listed as all other... . It would be good to get rid of that as it isn\u2019t adding any useful information to the map. In the Layer Styling panel untick the box on the left of the all other... category. The NULL symbols should all disappear from the map. Note that the Layers panel on the left now acts as a key to your waypoints layer. Changing to svg markers You can change the symbols by double-clicking on each symbol in turn and selecting different ones from the Gallery. At the moment all of your symbols are Simple markers . It is easy to change them to SVG markers and have a wider range of symbols to choose from. Double click on the first symbol in your list in the Layer Styling panel (in my example it is Bike shelter ) In the box at the top click where it says Simple marker Below that change the Symbol layer type to SVG marker SVG stands for Scaleable Vector Graphics and is basically what it says. In the context of QGIS it gives you a much greater range of pictorial symbols with which to style your map. Have a look at the SVG Image gallery at the bottom of the panel and select an appropriate symbol. You can use the settings above the change the size, colour, rotation etc. The symbols should appear on your map automatically, but if they don\u2019t click on Apply When you\u2019ve finished click on the back arrow at the top of the panel to get back to the list. Choose symbols for your points Continue in the same way to select appropriate symbols for the rest of the categories of point. Changing the coordinate system (CRS) of data The GPS data that you have collected is in the WGS 84 geographic coordinate system. Remember that you checked this earlier . QGIS sets the project CRS to that of the first layer that you add to the map. So in this case the map CRS is also WGS 84. Often you will need to use data in a local projected coordinate system. The obvious example is if you are using Ordnance Survey maps from Digimap in the same project. This is the example we will use now, but the same situation can arise if you are, for example, creating a map of Spain or Eire 2 . We\u2019ll set up a map project in British National Grid and add the gps data to that. Open QGIS from the start menu, but don\u2019t open a map. Use the browser panel to drag the LocationBNG.shp shapefile that you will have downloaded from Minerva to the Layers panel. It should appear in your map area. Remember that the first layer that you add to a map automatically sets the coordinate system. You may get a window like the one below asking about Transforms, just click OK on this for now. This is to do with ways of \u201ctransforming\u201d data from one CRS to another. You should find that you have a map with two polygons in a random colour. If you look at the bottom right of the map window you should be able to see the text EPSG:27700 . This is the code for British National Grid and confirms that your map is in the correct CRS. Save your map to the same folder as the previous map. Call it something like UniversityBNG.qgz - BNG = British National Grid. Add the OSM monochrome base map to your map again. You already have the plugin installed so don\u2019t need to do that again. Style the LocationBNG polygon layer so that it has an outline but no fill. You should be able to see the base map through it. Styling a polygon layer is very similar to styling points so you should be able to use the previous instructions again. Now it should be possible to see that both polygons cover parts of the University, but the one that is relevant for this map is the one to the south which covers Chancellors Court. Zoom in to the polygon to the south. Now add the Waypoints layer from your geopackage to the Layers panel from the Browser. They should appear in the correct place, even though they have a CRS of WGS 84 and the map is in British National Grid. You can check this in the layer properties if you want to. QGIS is projecting the layer \u201con the fly\u201d using a transformation . This is very convenient, and if you are just going to look at the map that is fine. But if you need to do any analysis or measure anything then you really need to get this layer projected in to British National Grid as well. To project the layer permanently Right click on the Waypoints layer in the Layers panel or in the Browser Export > Save features as... Fill in the Save Vector Layer as... dialog as follows The Format should be GeoPackage Click on the three dots button next to File name and browse to your existing Geopackage. Give the output a Layer name which will remind you what it contains, e.g. WaypointsBNG Drop down the CRS and select Project CRS: EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid . Finish by clicking OK Your map probably won\u2019t look much different but the new layer should have been added to the Layers panel. If it hasn\u2019t drag it over from the Browser. Check the new CRS by right-clicking on the new layer and going to Properties Look at the Information tab. The CRS heading should say EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid - Projected . If it doesn\u2019t you may have to try again and check everything carefully as you go along. Remove the original waypoints layer from your Layers panel and Save your map. Now you have a map in British National Grid which shows your waypoints and which, because all layers match the map CRS, can be used for analysis. Make sure you have both of your maps of Chancellors Court open in QGIS If you compare your two maps you should be able to see that the different CRS gives a very different idea of the \u201cshape\u201d of Chancellors Court. Copying styles If you want to style the point symbols on your BNG map so that they are the same as the WGS 84 map try the following: In the WGS 84 map right-click on the waypoints layer and select Styles > Copy Style > All style categories In the British National Grid map right-click on the waypoints layer and select Styles > Paste style > All style categories Your styles should be copied across and your map is ready to go! The final map Set the symbols on your map so that you are happy with them and zoom out so that a bit more of the University is visible. You should export your map from QGIS as an image and upload it to your GIS Portfolio. If you upload it within a week of the class I will give you feedback on your work. When you are happy with your map go to Project > Import / Export > Export Map to Image In the Save Map as Image dialog set the extent by clicking on the Map Canvas Extent button Click on Save In a later chapter you\u2019ll find out how to create a full map layout with a key, scale bar, measured grid etc and print or export that properly, but for now this is fine. Keep this project for the next chapter In the next chapter you will be creating data in QGIS by digitising. We will use the area of Chancellors Court again, so keep this project for that. Further information and suggested reading Many of the books in the reading list 3 have a general introduction to GIS which explain what it is and how it is used. Suggestions include the following: Chapter 2, Spatial data in Heywood, I., Cornelius, S. and Carver, S. (2011), pp.65-67 cover GPS. Chapter 4, Georeferencing in Longley, P.A. et al.

To install a new plugin: Click on Not installed on the left Type QuickMapServices into the search box at the top From the list that appears click on QuickMapServices and have a look at the description This plugin will do what you want it to do so click on Install Plugin Once it has installed you should get a message at the top telling you it has been successful and QuickMap Services should now be in the list of Installed plugins. You can Close the plugin manager now. Once the plugin is installed you will have new menu items and toolbar buttons available to you. On the menu go to Web > QuickMapServices . You should have a very long list of choices available. Go to OSM > OSM Standard . OSM stands for OpenStreetMap which is a crowd-sourced map of the World. It can be very useful for quick maps, but isn\u2019t always completely reliable and some areas don\u2019t have much data. Now that you\u2019ve added the OSM Standard basemap you should be able to see the details of Chancellors Court at the University with your waypoints shown on top.

This contains your features and data for each one which are called attributes . In the Layers panel right-click on your waypoints layer and select Open Attribute Table . The attribute table is the GIS equivalent of a spreadsheet and contains features and their attributes. Amongst many other attributes there should be one for name which should include the label or name of each waypoint as stored by the GPS unit. In this case the name field holds a number which matches the numbers of the points on the Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf file which you downloaded from Minerva.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to Introduction The data that you collected using GPS imported in to QGIS shows you one way of adding point data. You will almost certainly also come across point data as an Excel file or as a text file. If these contain x and y coordinates they can easily be added to GIS. Data to download You will be using the North Wales project that you created in the Introduction chapter. If you no longer have that project then you can download another copy from the Week 7 folder in Minerva. The data that you downloaded in Week 7 should contain a folder called GP_data That folder should contain an Excel spreadsheet called LlanbedrGravity.xls Creating xyz files Xyz files can be either comma separated value text files (often with an extension of .csv ) or Excel or OpenOffice spreadsheets. They contain point data which includes coordinates for a geographic location either in two dimensions (x and y) or three (x,y and z). Open the LlanbedrGravity.xls spreadsheet now and have a look at the data it contains. QGIS can only import xyz data from .csv files either saved from Excel or OpenOffice or created in a text editor such as Notepad++ (not Word!). So use Excel or OpenOffice to convert the Excel file to csv - File > Save As... set the format to CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv) (not to any of the other versions of csv) Warning Note that column headings need to be short and contain no spaces or non-standard characters - so text and numbers only.

These are in British National Grid 1 m coordinates (The grid numbers such as SH or SJ have been replaced with numbers - 22 and 23). Other numerical columns can be used for the z values, or the data. In this case we\u2019ll be using the CorrBA (Corrected Bouguer Anomaly in mGal) as the z values. Import points from xyz file to QGIS Start by opening your map of Llanbedr in North Wales in QGIS.

You need to tell QGIS which fields contain the x and y data before it can display it. Open the Data Source Manager - Layer > Data Source Manager In the File name field at the top browse to your csv file and select it Under Layer name type a name for your new layer, e.g. LlanbedrGravity Check that the File Format is set to CSV Next to Point coordinates set X field = Eastings Y field = Northings and check that the Geometry CRS is set to British National Grid Check that Use spatial index is ticked and that the Sample data below looks like your original spreadsheet.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate how to open a map project in QGIS select appropriate tools to navigate in a map document use layers to organise and display information on a map Introduction to the exercises The exercises in this workbook will build on each other so that by the end of this part of the module you will have used data from a variety of sources to create a map layout covering an area of North Wales near the village of Llanbedr. You will be able to include maps showing the gravity anomaly for the area and the geology. You will also include some interpretation of your maps. In this first section I have provided the data for you but as the exercises progress you will find out more about how to find your own data. Obtaining the data for this chapter You can download the data for this chapter from Minerva. Go to this module in Minerva, then to Learning Resources > GIS information > Week 7 Download NorthWalesDataQ.zip from this folder by right-clicking and saving to your local disk. Create a folder called gis in your file system. You\u2019ll need a total of about 170 MB of free space to complete the following exercises . Move the downloaded data into your gis folder Unzip the file in this location In My Computer right-click on the zip file If you have 7-zip go to 7-zip > Extract Here 1 If you don\u2019t have 7-zip, right-click Extract files... and select the location to save the files, then OK 2 Warning Never try to use the contents of a zipped file in QGIS without extracting it first - it won\u2019t work. If you are looking for a file in QGIS and can\u2019t find it, always check via My Computer that the file isn\u2019t inside a zip or 7zip archive. The contents of the zip file should look something like the following image when they are unzipped, with two further folders, a OSM.gpkg file and a NorthWales.qgz file. Opening the map project in QGIS The simplest way is to double-click on the NorthWales.qgz file in File Explorer . Alternatively first open QGIS by searching for it in the Start Menu box Then Project > Open navigate to where you put the project files and select NorthWales.qgz click Open The image below shows how the project will look in QGIS when you first open it. Note that yours may look different to mine as buttons and toolbars can vary in location. If you are using a version higher than 3.10.11 you may also get a notice at the top warning you about that. Just ignore it or close it, this won\u2019t be a problem for you. Navigation in QGIS Once you have data on a map in QGIS there are various tools which will allow you to zoom in and out and move around the map view. Zoom to Layer A lot of the work that you do in GIS will be layer-based. Each file that you add is a layer and will appear in the Layers panel on the left. Zoom to Layer is an extremely useful command to know and you\u2019ll probably find yourself using it a lot. Right-click on the Places layer (sub-heading) in the Layers panel Select Zoom to Layer Your map should zoom out so that you can see a bigger area of the Welsh coast. You\u2019re zoomed well out so this particular map looks a bit messy and may take a bit of time to load, but once it does you should be able to see Harlech and Dolgellau. The Map Navigation Toolbar Tools for zooming in and out and for moving around the map are available on the Map Navigation Toolbar . If the toolbar isn\u2019t already visible in QGIS go to View > Toolbars and tick the box next to Map Navigation Toolbar Trying out the navigation Try out the following tools in turn on your map so that you are aware of what they do. Pan - use the hand cursor to \u201cgrab\u201d the map and move it around Zoom in - click on the button, then on the map. You can also use the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out of your map. Zoom out - click on the button, then on the map. You can also use the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out of your map. Full extent to see the whole map (again be patient while it loads) - then use Zoom to Layer to get back to the extent of the Places layer. Working with map layers in QGIS Layers are an essential part of any GIS. Each layer is a reference to a particular data source. In this project the layers so far include: Places Line features Polygon features Tidal water The Layers panel on the left hand side of the map window shows the layers that are in your map and how their features look and allows you to control their visibility. Viewing contents of layers If you have added vector data, which all of the layers so far are, you\u2019ll also be able to refer to the layers panel as a key to your symbols. This is particularly useful if a layer has multiple symbols. Click on the little arrow next to the Polygon features layer - assuming it started \u201cclosed\u201d, you should now be able to see lots of different symbols and an explanation of what they show. Click on the little arrow again to fold the list away and repeat this for the Places and Line features layers. Making layers visible and invisible There will be times when you don\u2019t want all of the layers to be visible on your map, but you won\u2019t necessarily want to actually remove them completely. It is simple to make layers visible and invisible. Click in the little box next to one of the layers - the tick will disappear and so will that layer in your map To make the layer visible click in the little box again. You\u2019ll notice in layers with multiple symbols that you can turn each of those off individually too. For example, Fold down the Places layer in the contents then untick next to Town The names for Harlech and Dolgellau should disappear, but if you zoom in you will still be able to see the other place names. Make sure you tick back in the Town box. Locating features The layers in your map at the moment are vector feature classes and are searchable (you\u2019ll find out more about the data types raster and vector later). Click in the Type to locate box at the lower left, or use Ctrl+K on the keyboard Have a look at the list of options that pops up - it looks a bit confusing to start with but is simple to use. Type the following in the box - af Harlech . The af shows that you want to search for Features in all layers As you type a list of options will appear - double-click on one of the options for Harlech Castle (it doesn\u2019t matter which) This can be a useful way of finding things on your map if you are using vector layers. Adding layers to QGIS with the Browser Now have a look at the Browser panel If you can\u2019t see the Browser which shows you where files are on your file system, go to: View > Panels and tick in the box next to Browser Using the Browser you should be able to navigate to the folder in which you saved your downloads. If you have saved your data in the same folder as the map you should be able to find everything under the Project Home heading, otherwise you\u2019ll have to browse through your file system. Browse to your downloaded files and look for a folder called gb-overview have a look in the folder and find a file called GBOverview.tif drag and drop that file to the Layers panel Right-click on the GBOverview layer in the Layers panel and Zoom to layer You should now be able to see a map of Great Britain in the main panel. This is probably the easiest way to add data to your maps. Adding raster data to a map with the Data Source Manager As with so many tasks in GIS there is more than one way to add data to QGIS. On the menu bar go to Layer > Data Source Manager Click on Raster on the left then click on the button with three dots next to the Source box Navigate to the raster-25k folder and select raster-25k_3706482.tif Click on Open Then click on Add , and then on Close The new layer will be added to your Layers panel, but you probably won\u2019t be able to see it on your map as it only covers a small area. Right-click on the raster-25k layer in the Layers panel and Zoom to Layer to be able to see the new map. It won\u2019t look great at this zoom level, but you can use the Zoom in button, or the middle mouse button, to see it more clearly. These two new layers are raster data types. Again, you\u2019ll find out more about these later. Adding vector data to a map The vector files on this map are all stored in a Geopackage called OSM.gpkg . This is a form of database which stores and retrieves spatial data efficiently. If you look at this in File Explorer you\u2019ll note that it looks like a single file. If you look at it in the Browser in QGIS you\u2019ll see there is a little arrow next to it - the advantage of using the browser is that it is specifically designed to work with spatial data. Drop down the little arrow next to OSM.gpkg You should be able to see the layers that are stored in the geopackage - as in the image above Select the multilinestrings layer in the Browser and drag and drop it into the Layers panel You may need to Zoom to layer to see what you have just added. It should be a few lines in a random colour. You can also add vector layers via the Data Source Manager Go to Layer > Data Source Manager Click on Vector on the left then click on the button with three dots next to the Source box Navigate to the OSM.gpkg file and select it Click on Open (If you\u2019re using a newer version of QGIS you\u2019ll also need to click on Add ) You\u2019ll get a choice of vector layers to add - select the points layer Then click on OK , and then on Close The new layer will be added to your Layers panel and you should see a lot of randomly coloured point symbols on your map. Removing layers Your map is looking rather a mess now, so let\u2019s clear it up a bit. You won\u2019t need the GBOverview, points and multilinestrings layers for the rest of this exercise so they can be removed . Note that removing layers from your map does just that. You are not deleting the data from your disk, they still exist, but you are removing the link between the map and your data. Right-click on the points layer (it may appear as OSM points ) Remove layer... You\u2019ll be asked to confirm that you want to remove the layer, click on OK Repeat the process with the multilinestrings and GBOverview layers. The process is identical for raster and vector layers. Ordering the layers in the Layers panel The order of the layers in the Layers panel affects how they appear on the map. Layers at the top of the list appear on top of the layers lower down. At the moment you probably have the raster-25 layer above the other layers, so you can\u2019t see them at the moment - though the labels still appear. Drag and drop the raster-25k layer from the top of the list in the Layers panel to the bottom. Again, your map will look rather a mess. Just make the following layers invisible for now. Places Line features Polygon features Tidal water You will be working with this map for the rest of the course so go to the correct area by using Type to locate to find Llanbedr Airfield . Saving your map Save your map projects at regular intervals. You will be doing a lot of work on them and can lose a lot of time if you have to do your work again because the program has crashed. Project > Save or alternatively Ctrl + S (Windows) If this is the first time you\u2019ve saved it, make sure you remember where you have saved it to and give the file a name which will help you remember what it is. It is a good idea to save all of your files to the same gis folder and make sub folders for each individual project. It is also a good idea to keep back up copies of your project and of the data files. Particularly once you start editing, problems can corrupt the whole file, so make a copy of your gis folder on a separate disk/drive/usb stick each time you finish a session working on them. Checking and setting the coordinate system The coordinate system is an important property which tells QGIS where data is located on the surface of the Earth and what measurement system is used for your datasets. It is important to have this set correctly or the layers in your map will not display correctly. If you are working in Great Britain then the coordinate system is most likely to be British National Grid, though you may also have data in the unprojected WGS 1984. For this project we will be working in British National Grid . QGIS will set the coordinate system of the map to that of the first data layer that is added. In this case it was the Places layer. Check whether the coordinate system is set correctly as follows: Go to Project > Properties and click on the CRS heading to the left This rather complex-looking dialog controls the CRS or Coordinate Reference System for the whole project. Look at the box to the left of the map - this shows that the CRS is currently set to British National Grid. The map on the right confirms that this CRS covers the correct area. It is possible to use the Filter box at the top to search for other coordinate systems, though this isn\u2019t necessary for this project. Click OK to close the project properties. If you look at the bottom right of the map window you should also see that the CRS is shown there, but this time only as a short numerical code - EPSG:27700 . If you click on this you will be taken to the CRS tab of the project properties. The final map for this chapter You should finish this chapter with a map of the Llanbedr Airfield on the Welsh coast. Your map and the rest of the project should look something like the image below, though your map may cover a slightly different area. It isn\u2019t a problem if it does. If you want me to give you feedback on this map, or on any stage of the process, please upload a screenshot to your GIS Portfolio - you\u2019ll be given instructions on how to get access to this in the class. If you upload anything please email me to let me know that you have done so. Don\u2019t forget to save and backup this project. You\u2019ll be using it for the rest of this course so make sure that you have it with you next week. Further information and suggested reading Many of the books in the reading list 3 have a general introduction to GIS which explain what it is and how it is used. Suggestions include the following: Chapter 1, What is GIS? in Heywood, I., Cornelius, S. and Carver, S. (2011), pp. 2-30 Chapter 1, Systems, Science and Study in Longley, P.A. et al. (2015), pp. 3-37 What is GIS? and some example applications ESRI UK (who publish proprietry GIS software ArcGIS) have a web page which includes an Overview of GIS and a GIS Showcase which includes examples of how GIS can be used. The webpage GIS for Science gives a lot more ideas for how GIS can be used by scientists. 7-zip is also open-source so if you want to install a copy on your own Windows computer you can - just download it from the 7-zip webpage . \u21a9 Note that these instructions are for Windows, if you are on a Mac or Linux computer you will still need to unzip the files, but I don\u2019t have access to one of these to write the instructions. \u21a9 The reading list is available in Minerva and from the library (search for the number of this module). \u21a9","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction-to-gis-with-qgis","text":"The background to GIS and an explanation of what it is will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

This is a form of database which stores and retrieves spatial data efficiently. If you look at this in File Explorer you\u2019ll note that it looks like a single file. If you look at it in the Browser in QGIS you\u2019ll see there is a little arrow next to it - the advantage of using the browser is that it is specifically designed to work with spatial data. Drop down the little arrow next to OSM.gpkg You should be able to see the layers that are stored in the geopackage - as in the image above Select the multilinestrings layer in the Browser and drag and drop it into the Layers panel You may need to Zoom to layer to see what you have just added. It should be a few lines in a random colour. You can also add vector layers via the Data Source Manager Go to Layer > Data Source Manager Click on Vector on the left then click on the button with three dots next to the Source box Navigate to the OSM.gpkg file and select it Click on Open (If you\u2019re using a newer version of QGIS you\u2019ll also need to click on Add ) You\u2019ll get a choice of vector layers to add - select the points layer Then click on OK , and then on Close The new layer will be added to your Layers panel and you should see a lot of randomly coloured point symbols on your map.","title":"Adding vector data to a map"},{"location":"introduction/#removing-layers","text":"Your map is looking rather a mess now, so let\u2019s clear it up a bit. You won\u2019t need the GBOverview, points and multilinestrings layers for the rest of this exercise so they can be removed . Note that removing layers from your map does just that. You are not deleting the data from your disk, they still exist, but you are removing the link between the map and your data. Right-click on the points layer (it may appear as OSM points ) Remove layer... You\u2019ll be asked to confirm that you want to remove the layer, click on OK Repeat the process with the multilinestrings and GBOverview layers. The process is identical for raster and vector layers.","title":"Removing layers"},{"location":"introduction/#ordering-the-layers-in-the-layers-panel","text":"The order of the layers in the Layers panel affects how they appear on the map. Layers at the top of the list appear on top of the layers lower down. At the moment you probably have the raster-25 layer above the other layers, so you can\u2019t see them at the moment - though the labels still appear. Drag and drop the raster-25k layer from the top of the list in the Layers panel to the bottom. Again, your map will look rather a mess. Just make the following layers invisible for now. Places Line features Polygon features Tidal water You will be working with this map for the rest of the course so go to the correct area by using Type to locate to find Llanbedr Airfield .","title":"Ordering the layers in the Layers panel"},{"location":"introduction/#saving-your-map","text":"Save your map projects at regular intervals. You will be doing a lot of work on them and can lose a lot of time if you have to do your work again because the program has crashed. Project > Save or alternatively Ctrl + S (Windows) If this is the first time you\u2019ve saved it, make sure you remember where you have saved it to and give the file a name which will help you remember what it is. It is a good idea to save all of your files to the same gis folder and make sub folders for each individual project. It is also a good idea to keep back up copies of your project and of the data files. Particularly once you start editing, problems can corrupt the whole file, so make a copy of your gis folder on a separate disk/drive/usb stick each time you finish a session working on them.","title":"Saving your map"},{"location":"introduction/#checking-and-setting-the-coordinate-system","text":"The coordinate system is an important property which tells QGIS where data is located on the surface of the Earth and what measurement system is used for your datasets. It is important to have this set correctly or the layers in your map will not display correctly. If you are working in Great Britain then the coordinate system is most likely to be British National Grid, though you may also have data in the unprojected WGS 1984. For this project we will be working in British National Grid . QGIS will set the coordinate system of the map to that of the first data layer that is added. In this case it was the Places layer. Check whether the coordinate system is set correctly as follows: Go to Project > Properties and click on the CRS heading to the left This rather complex-looking dialog controls the CRS or Coordinate Reference System for the whole project. Look at the box to the left of the map - this shows that the CRS is currently set to British National Grid. The map on the right confirms that this CRS covers the correct area. It is possible to use the Filter box at the top to search for other coordinate systems, though this isn\u2019t necessary for this project. Click OK to close the project properties. If you look at the bottom right of the map window you should also see that the CRS is shown there, but this time only as a short numerical code - EPSG:27700 . If you click on this you will be taken to the CRS tab of the project properties.","title":"Checking and setting the coordinate system"},{"location":"introduction/#the-final-map-for-this-chapter","text":"You should finish this chapter with a map of the Llanbedr Airfield on the Welsh coast.

If you want me to give you feedback on this map, or on any stage of the process, please upload a screenshot to your GIS Portfolio - you\u2019ll be given instructions on how to get access to this in the class. If you upload anything please email me to let me know that you have done so. Don\u2019t forget to save and backup this project.

Important Please be aware that it is essential for this module that you have access to particular GIS software - QGIS. The full instructions are below. Make sure that you have followed these instructions as soon as possible and confirmed that you have access to the software. You will need to start using QGIS in the class in week 7, and will not be able to progress with the exercises without it. If you have problems installing or accessing QGIS for any reason please contact me immediately so that I can help you - c.e.gordon@leeds.ac.uk Installing QGIS on your own computer This is the preferred method of using QGIS. If at all possible you should install it on your own computer as the version in the Virtual Windows Desktop is rather out of date. Instructions for using the Virtual Windows Desktop follow this section just in case you do need to use it. QGIS is Open Source Software which can be downloaded for Windows, Mac and Linux and is freely available from the QGIS web page Which version? QGIS maintains a Long term release (LTR) version as well as the latest version. At the moment the latest is version 3.16.0 and the long term release is version 3.10.11. I would advise that you install the latest version, but you can complete all of the work for this module using the LTR and that is the more stable version. So either are fine. Go to the QGIS Download page and go to the section for your operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux). If you are on Windows download one of the Standalone Installer versions rather than the Network Installer. If your computer is Windows 10 you should download the 64 bit version. Install the appropriate version following the usual method for your operating system, then make sure that you start QGIS to check that it works. If the installation is successful you should be able to see something like the screen below. Let me know if it does or doesn\u2019t work Please email me, Clare Gordon when you have successfully opened QGIS. Also email me if you can\u2019t get it to work. Once you have QGIS working you are set up and ready for the first class. You don\u2019t need to look at or follow the next set of instructions unless you are unable to install QGIS on your own computer. Using QGIS on the Virtual Windows Desktop From April 2020 it is possible to log in to a Virtual Windows Desktop to use QGIS. The Virtual Desktop will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. You need to install a client on your machine for the best access though it is apparently possible to run it in a web browser. Note that QGIS may not necessarily work via a web browser so the desktop client is preferred. Warning Note that the version of QGIS on the VWD is out of date, version 3.6 rather than a minimum of 3.10. Some plugins will not install or run, which will have an effect on completing the exercises for this module. If you are unable to install the software for some reason, this is the best way to access QGIS. Please make sure that you read all of the information in the IT knowledge base article about the Virtual Windows Desktop before you go ahead with this: Direct link to information about downloading and installing the VWD The important things to note are that capacity is limited, so if you can install QGIS on your own computer using the instructions above, please do so. again, capacity is limited, so if you do access QGIS by this route, make sure that you log off the Virtual Desktop when you have finished with it. GIS can very slowly in the Virtual Desktop if your data is on your M: drive. To get around this, copy your data to the Desktop, work on it, then copy it back to either your M: drive, or OneDrive . Data on the Desktop is deleted when you log out of the Virtual Desktop, or are timed out. Warning If you copy your data to the Virtual Desktop it is essential that you remember to then copy it back to either your M: drive or OneDrive before you log out. If you don\u2019t, you will lose the work that you have been doing. I will try to remind you of this at regular intervals during the exercises. When you have installed the virtual desktop client and opened it you should have an icon showing a computer with Academic written underneath. Click on the icon to open the actual desktop. Be patient as it is a bit slow. You\u2019ll be asked to log in with your usual University username and password. Once it has loaded your screen will be filled by a new desktop (your usual one is still there in the background). You\u2019ll need to double-click on an icon labelled AppsAnywhere Portal which opens a list of software Look for QGIS and click on Launch Hopefully QGIS will open, but again, it could be rather slow. Getting help with installation If you have problems you will need to contact the IT helpdesk - check you are logged on to Minerva then go to IT Services and log either an issue or a request. For an issue or problem go to Something broken? and fill in the form For a general request go to Request Something then Log a general Request and fill in the form.","title":"Access to software for GIS exercises"},{"location":"software/software/#access-to-software-for-gis-exercises","text":"Last Modified: 05 Nov 20, 12:50:32 These instructions only apply to students and staff at the University of Leeds.
