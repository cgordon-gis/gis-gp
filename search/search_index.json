The lecture segment should help you to understand why you are doing these exercises. If you still aren\u2019t sure, please ask Clare . Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate that you can find suitable data for GIS projects from a variety of sources describe the main types of data used in GIS acknowledge the data that you use in your maps in a suitable fashion Introduction Being able to find, download and prepare your own data is an essential part of using GIS. While the data will be provided for you for many of the exercises in this module, you will find it useful to have some idea of where the data comes from, and what there is available for you to use for your own maps. While downloading shouldn\u2019t take too long, don\u2019t leave it until the last minute before you have to produce a map. Websites can become unavailable either permanently or temporarily, or computers can crash. Digimap Digimap is a service provided to Higher Education in the U.K. by EDINA at Edinburgh University. Digimap provides a front end to digital maps and data of Great Britain from the Ordnance Survey and British Geological Survey, amongst others. The University of Leeds subscribes to the collections and as a student you have access to maps and data for use as part of your studies. Logging in to Digimap If you have not used Digimap before you will need to register and log in using your University ID, that is the username and password that you use to access University systems such as Minerva. Full instructions for logging in are on the Digimap help pages . Go to the Digimap Collections page at https://digimap.edina.ac.uk Click the Log in button at the top right of the screen type Leeds in the box and select University of Leeds from the list of available institutions You should get the familiar University of Leeds log in page, so type your University username and password into the appropriate boxes and then click the Log in button. If you are already logged in to Minerva you may find that you don\u2019t have to enter your login details again. If this is the first time that you\u2019ve logged in to Digimap you\u2019ll be asked to register for each collection separately, though you can do all at one go. You won\u2019t need to use all of the collections during this module, but it\u2019s worth registering for all that are available to you so that you can explore them for yourself. The University does not subscribe to Marine or Global Digimap. Go through the list of collections, read and accept the conditions for each one, selecting Academic Works (coursework, projects, dissertations etc.) in the Purpose dropdown for each. Once you submit all of those you should be taken to the Digimap initial page again, as shown below, but this time you should see your name at top right rather than the log in button. The list includes options for a large number of collections. In this workbook we\u2019ll only be looking at the collections that are the most relevant for creating the maps you\u2019ll need during your course, but if you are interested in any of the others feel free to explore them. EDINA have worked to make all of the tools similar across each collection, so just have a go! Browsing maps on screen Each Digimap collection provides a Roam and a Download interface. The Roam interface allows you to view the data from that collection on a map on screen. Using Digimap OS Roam As an example click on Ordnance Survey on the menu at the top of the main screen Then select Roam under View, annotate & print a map on the right. Have a go at zooming in and out and exploring the map at different scales. Try searching for a location in the Search box at the top left. In this module we\u2019ll be making most use of the Download interface, but it\u2019s worth knowing what the Roam interface will do too, so have a quick go with a few of the tools on the left before continuing with the next exercise. If you want more information about using the Roam interface have a look at the Digimap Resource Centre which is linked from Resources on the main page. Downloading data from Digimap Data Download is the tool for downloading data for use in GIS or CAD software. The format that the data is delivered in will determine whether you will be able to open it directly in a software package or whether you will need to convert it. We\u2019ll be using data from Digimap in QGIS for various exercises in the rest of this module, so you need to know your way around this section. Instructions for converting, importing and viewing file types that need it will be given later in the workbook. As an example of the download interface we\u2019ll download some Ordnance Survey data. Start from the Digimap main page (you can get back to it by clicking on the icon at the top right of the map - hover over to see a tool tip) click on Ordnance Survey in the menu at the top of the page from the Ordnance Survey page choose Data Download Data Download takes you to a map that looks very similar to Digimap Roam, but with some important differences. Selecting an area On the left there is a menu panel with options for selecting an area, with a search box above it. Click in the Search box and type Otley , then press Enter or click on the magnifying glass to search When you get the results click on Otley (Leeds) to zoom in, then close the search results Under Draw click on the rectangle and use the mouse to draw a box around the area shown by an orange box in the image below, clicking to start and finish the box. It doesn\u2019t matter if the box you draw is a bit bigger, but try not to make it any smaller. Area view Note that the map you see on the screen only shows the area that you will be downloading data for, not the actual data that you\u2019ll be downloading. You\u2019ll select the data in the next section so don\u2019t worry what it looks like for now. Selecting data sets Now that you have selected an area you have to select the data that you need. Back in the panel on the left, under Select Data Products , drop down each of the headings, e.g. Backdrop Mapping, in turn by clicking on the arrow next to them. There are a lot of different data sets here and most of them won\u2019t mean anything to you. For now select the following data sets when you find them, by putting a tick in the box next to them. Backdrop mapping: VectorMap Local Raster Land and Height data: OS Terrain 5 Contours You can get more information about the data sets by clicking on the arrow next to them. This includes information on licences - which you will need to know later. The number on the right in brackets under Order Size shows how many tiles your selected area uses out of the maximum downloadable number. If you have chosen a slightly different area to me your number may be different but you should still be well within the limit. When you have selected the data you require click on Add to Basket (Don\u2019t worry, despite the Basket and Checkout you won\u2019t be charged. The University has already paid the subscription.) Your basket should appear with details of your order. Some datasets will give you an option to change the format. In this case click on Select Format next to the OS Terrain 5 Contours. The choices are Shape, GML3 or DWG . Choose Shape in this case. You may also need to select a theme. For the VectorMap Local Raster there is a choice of themes - pick Black and white for this exercise, though it is worth downloading the others to have a look at them too. Some items will have a Clip option. This means that the data will be sent to you clipped to the area outline that you requested. If you are short of disk space this is very useful as it restricts the amount of data you need to download, but otherwise it doesn\u2019t hurt to have extra data around the outside of your study area. I prefer to untick this box and download full map tiles. Give the order a name, e.g. OtleyOS (for Ordnance Survey). This will be part of the file name of the zip file that you download, so try to make it short but helpful! Click on Request Download Downloading your data. You\u2019ll receive an email confirming your order, then another with a download link. This can sometimes take a while to arrive, depending on how busy the service is. Make sure that you are still logged in to Digimap before you click on the download link. Once you have clicked on the link a browser window should open telling you that your order is ready to download. Click on Download You\u2019ll download a zip file. NOTE: Don\u2019t run or open the file directly from your browser, and make sure that you DON\u2019T save your zip file to a temp folder where you will probably be unable to unzip it. Warning Make sure that you remember where you have saved the zip file. Now open File Explorer (in Windows) and navigate to the location where you saved the zip file. Right-click on the compressed map data file that downloaded and choose to Extract files... - or 7-zip > Extract files... if you have 7-zip available. Select where you want to save the extracted files, and make a note of where you save them to You should end up with a folder for each dataset that you requested plus text files showing citations and contents. The folders will also have the order number as part of their name. Viewing your data In this case the files that you have downloaded are either tiff graphics files or shapefiles. Navigate to the data that you downloaded in the file explorer and find the folder called something like vml-raster_bwr_3612556 (your order number will be different). you\u2019ll also need to go into a folder with the OS grid letters - in this case for Otley it should be se Open one of the .tif files by double-clicking on it - the file should open in a graphics program, but that depends what you have set up on your computer. Don\u2019t worry if it doesn\u2019t! You should be able to see that this is basically a \u201cpicture\u201d of a map. Try opening one of the .shp files from the terrain-5_3612555 folder too. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to. Just cancel that and don\u2019t try finding software that will open it! Warning Both folders will contain files that have similar names to the .shp and .tif files, but different file extensions. These won\u2019t open in any programme but are essential for using the data in GIS programs such as QGIS, so make sure that you always keep these files together. Both of these formats will open in QGIS in the same way that you added data to your map in the Introduction to GIS . You don\u2019t need to keep the files that you have just downloaded. Copyright acknowledgements for Digimap data Copyright is important. Remember that most data providers ask you to sign up to conditions that include an obligation to add a copyright acknowledgement to your map. Check what that copyright statement is and add it. When you signed up to use the Digimap collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. The wording does change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check it for yourself. To find these copyright acknowledgements: go back to the main Digimap home page go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements under Popular Resources and click on it Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used - in this case the Ordnance Survey Collection You may need to download a pdf file rather than see it on a web page - do so and then open the pdf. then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text. For example, as of August 2020 when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your maps. \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Adding the copyright symbol to your text To add the copyright symbol - \u00a9 - to your text check that the Num lock is on on the keyboard hold down the Alt key on the keyboard then use the number pad to type 0169 release the Alt key Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when you registered. If you are not using U.K. Ordnance Survey data this is not the correct copyright acknowledgement to use. For example, if you are using data for Spain or the United States, or indeed UK data that you haven\u2019t downloaded from Digimap. You\u2019ll need to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for yourself. Advice on citing Digimap data , as opposed to the copyright acknowledgement is given in the Digimap Resource Centre. The GIS Lounge page on How to cite GIS materials gives some information about citing the software as well as the data. Have a look at that and follow the suggestions to cite non-Digimap data. Other Digimap collections In addition to Ordnance Survey Digimap you will also find that you\u2019ll make use of some of the other collections, in particular Geology Digimap and Aerial Digimap . The Roam and Download interfaces work in a very similar way to the Ordnance Survey collection so you should find that you already know how to use them. You\u2019ll be downloading BGS data from Digimap and adding it to your map of the Llanbedr area later in the course. You have access to all of these collections so feel free to have a look at what is available and make use of any of the data or maps in your work. Exploring other Digimap collections Go into the Historic Digimap Collection and use Historic Roam to look up either your house or the University using old maps. Try the 2 up view to see how you can compare old and new mapping of the same area. Digimap Collections online help Digimap help is available from each of the collection pages. Click on the links in the left-hand menu for more information about how to use the services and file formats. Alternatively use the Help links from within Roam or Download or use the videos that EDINA have uploaded to YouTube If you want more detailed information EDINA provide e-learning units which are linked from the main Digimap home page . Data from the web EDINA Digimap provides a wide range of useful data covering the UK, but you are also likely to need data from outwith the UK, or UK data that isn\u2019t provided by Digimap. It isn\u2019t possible to cover everything in this session, but I will show you one particular source which you should find useful. Natural Earth Data Natural Earth is a free, public domain dataset consisting of raster and vector data that will allow you to make maps at general scales. If you want a map of the World, or a general map of a particular country, this is a good starting point. Start by going to Natural Earth in your browser The front page gives an overview of the principles behind the data and an idea of the scales at which it is available. You can find more information under the Features tab, including the file formats and the coordinate system - both important for using the data within GIS. Natural Earth data Go to the Features page and make a note of the file types of both the raster and vector data provided by Natural Earth and of the coordinate system that the data comes in. To download data either Click the Get the Data green button on the front page or click on the Downloads tab at the top of the site Choose the scale that you want to download and the type of data that you want, e.g. cultural, physical or raster For this exercise download the following data: Medium scale data, 1:50m > Cultural > Admin 0 - Countries - click on the Download countries button to download a zip file. Make a note of where this file is saved to on your disk. Medium scale data, 1:50m > Raster > Natural Earth 1 - click the Download small size button under Natural Earth 1 with Shaded Relief and Water . Again, make a note of where the zip file is saved. Keep these data layers for later exercises. If you are working on a University computer you will need to make sure that the files are within your own disk space, either on your M: drive, or a USB drive. If you are working on the VWD make sure that you save the data to your network (M:/ drive). Have a look at the summary of the data on the Features page. If you wish try downloading other datasets. You can try adding them to a blank map in QGIS in the same way that you added data in the Introduction to GIS. Natural Earth data copyright Finding and acknowledging the copyright of data is very important. Return to the Natural Earth front page Look at the text in the box next to the Get the Data button. One of the links there is to the Terms of Use page. Click on that now. Acknowledging Natural Earth data Read the Terms of Use of Natural Earth data How should you acknowledge the Natural Earth data if you use it in one of your maps? The terms of use do say that \u201cCrediting the authors is unnecessary\u201d, however, it is still a good idea to add the data acknowledgement to your map to avoid any possibility of plagiarism. You can choose whether to use the short or long text listed on the page. Adding the url of the data can also be a very good idea. Finding other data online These are just a few examples of finding useful data for GIS. Through out the rest of the workbook you\u2019ll be downloading your own data from Digimap. If you need data from elsewhere I\u2019ll either give full instructions or provide the data for you, but tell you where I got it from. If you are looking for data for a particular project it is well worth searching online using your favourite search engine (e.g. Google). Put the words \u201cgis\u201d and \u201cdata\u201d into your searches and it should help you to find relevant data. I have put together a short list of possible data sources which you are welcome to use to find data and maps.","title":"Finding spatial data"},{"location":"finding_data/#finding-spatial-data-to-use-in-gis","text":"The background to finding data will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

Remember that most data providers ask you to sign up to conditions that include an obligation to add a copyright acknowledgement to your map. Check what that copyright statement is and add it. When you signed up to use the Digimap collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. The wording does change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check it for yourself. To find these copyright acknowledgements: go back to the main Digimap home page go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements under Popular Resources and click on it Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used - in this case the Ordnance Survey Collection You may need to download a pdf file rather than see it on a web page - do so and then open the pdf. then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text. For example, as of August 2020 when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your maps. \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Adding the copyright symbol to your text To add the copyright symbol - \u00a9 - to your text check that the Num lock is on on the keyboard hold down the Alt key on the keyboard then use the number pad to type 0169 release the Alt key Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when you registered. If you are not using U.K. Ordnance Survey data this is not the correct copyright acknowledgement to use. For example, if you are using data for Spain or the United States, or indeed UK data that you haven\u2019t downloaded from Digimap. You\u2019ll need to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for yourself. Advice on citing Digimap data , as opposed to the copyright acknowledgement is given in the Digimap Resource Centre.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate how to open a map project in QGIS select appropriate tools to navigate in a map document use layers to organise and display information on a map Introduction to the exercises The exercises in this workbook will build on each other so that by the end of this part of the module you will have used data from a variety of sources to create a map layout covering an area of North Wales near the village of Llanbedr. You will be able to include maps showing the gravity anomaly for the area and the geology. You will also include some interpretation of your maps. In this first section I have provided the data for you but as the exercises progress you will find out more about how to find your own data. Obtaining the data for this chapter You can download the data for this chapter from Minerva. Go to this module in Minerva, then to Learning Resources > GIS information > Week 7 Download NorthWalesDataQ.zip from this folder by right-clicking and saving to your local disk. Create a folder called gis in your file system. You\u2019ll need a total of about 170 MB of free space to complete the following exercises . Move the downloaded data into your gis folder Unzip the file in this location In My Computer right-click on the zip file If you have 7-zip go to 7-zip > Extract Here 1 If you don\u2019t have 7-zip, right-click Extract files... and select the location to save the files, then OK 2 Warning Never try to use the contents of a zipped file in QGIS without extracting it first - it won\u2019t work. If you are looking for a file in QGIS and can\u2019t find it, always check via My Computer that the file isn\u2019t inside a zip or 7zip archive. The contents of the zip file should look something like the following image when they are unzipped, with two further folders, a OSM.gpkg file and a NorthWales.qgz file. Opening the map project in QGIS The simplest way is to double-click on the NorthWales.qgz file in File Explorer . Alternatively first open QGIS by searching for it in the Start Menu box Then Project > Open navigate to where you put the project files and select NorthWales.qgz click Open The image below shows how the project will look in QGIS when you first open it. Note that yours may look different to mine as buttons and toolbars can vary in location. If you are using a version higher than 3.10.11 you may also get a notice at the top warning you about that. Just ignore it or close it, this won\u2019t be a problem for you. Navigation in QGIS Once you have data on a map in QGIS there are various tools which will allow you to zoom in and out and move around the map view. Zoom to Layer A lot of the work that you do in GIS will be layer-based. Each file that you add is a layer and will appear in the Layers panel on the left. Zoom to Layer is an extremely useful command to know and you\u2019ll probably find yourself using it a lot. Right-click on the Places layer (sub-heading) in the Layers panel Select Zoom to Layer Your map should zoom out so that you can see a bigger area of the Welsh coast. You\u2019re zoomed well out so this particular map looks a bit messy and may take a bit of time to load, but once it does you should be able to see Harlech and Dolgellau. The Map Navigation Toolbar Tools for zooming in and out and for moving around the map are available on the Map Navigation Toolbar . If the toolbar isn\u2019t already visible in QGIS go to View > Toolbars and tick the box next to Map Navigation Toolbar Trying out the navigation Try out the following tools in turn on your map so that you are aware of what they do. Pan - use the hand cursor to \u201cgrab\u201d the map and move it around Zoom in - click on the button, then on the map. You can also use the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out of your map. Zoom out - click on the button, then on the map. You can also use the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out of your map. Full extent to see the whole map (again be patient while it loads) - then use Zoom to Layer to get back to the extent of the Places layer. Working with map layers in QGIS Layers are an essential part of any GIS. Each layer is a reference to a particular data source. In this project the layers so far include: Places Line features Polygon features Tidal water The Layers panel on the left hand side of the map window shows the layers that are in your map and how their features look and allows you to control their visibility. Viewing contents of layers If you have added vector data, which all of the layers so far are, you\u2019ll also be able to refer to the layers panel as a key to your symbols. This is particularly useful if a layer has multiple symbols. Click on the little arrow next to the Polygon features layer - assuming it started \u201cclosed\u201d, you should now be able to see lots of different symbols and an explanation of what they show. Click on the little arrow again to fold the list away and repeat this for the Places and Line features layers. Making layers visible and invisible There will be times when you don\u2019t want all of the layers to be visible on your map, but you won\u2019t necessarily want to actually remove them completely. It is simple to make layers visible and invisible. Click in the little box next to one of the layers - the tick will disappear and so will that layer in your map To make the layer visible click in the little box again. You\u2019ll notice in layers with multiple symbols that you can turn each of those off individually too. For example, Fold down the Places layer in the contents then untick next to Town The names for Harlech and Dolgellau should disappear, but if you zoom in you will still be able to see the other place names. Make sure you tick back in the Town box. Locating features The layers in your map at the moment are vector feature classes and are searchable (you\u2019ll find out more about the data types raster and vector later). Click in the Type to locate box at the lower left, or use Ctrl+K on the keyboard Have a look at the list of options that pops up - it looks a bit confusing to start with but is simple to use. Type the following in the box - af Harlech . The af shows that you want to search for Features in all layers As you type a list of options will appear - double-click on one of the options for Harlech Castle (it doesn\u2019t matter which) This can be a useful way of finding things on your map if you are using vector layers. Adding layers to QGIS with the Browser Now have a look at the Browser panel If you can\u2019t see the Browser which shows you where files are on your file system, go to: View > Panels and tick in the box next to Browser Using the Browser you should be able to navigate to the folder in which you saved your downloads. If you have saved your data in the same folder as the map you should be able to find everything under the Project Home heading, otherwise you\u2019ll have to browse through your file system. Browse to your downloaded files and look for a folder called gb-overview have a look in the folder and find a file called GBOverview.tif drag and drop that file to the Layers panel Right-click on the GBOverview layer in the Layers panel and Zoom to layer You should now be able to see a map of Great Britain in the main panel. This is probably the easiest way to add data to your maps. Adding raster data to a map with the Data Source Manager As with so many tasks in GIS there is more than one way to add data to QGIS. On the menu bar go to Layer > Data Source Manager Click on Raster on the left then click on the button with three dots next to the Source box Navigate to the raster-25k folder and select raster-25k_3706482.tif Click on Open Then click on Add , and then on Close The new layer will be added to your Layers panel, but you probably won\u2019t be able to see it on your map as it only covers a small area. Right-click on the raster-25k layer in the Layers panel and Zoom to Layer to be able to see the new map. It won\u2019t look great at this zoom level, but you can use the Zoom in button, or the middle mouse button, to see it more clearly. These two new layers are raster data types. Again, you\u2019ll find out more about these later. Adding vector data to a map The vector files on this map are all stored in a Geopackage called OSM.gpkg . This is a form of database which stores and retrieves spatial data efficiently. If you look at this in File Explorer you\u2019ll note that it looks like a single file. If you look at it in the Browser in QGIS you\u2019ll see there is a little arrow next to it - the advantage of using the browser is that it is specifically designed to work with spatial data. Drop down the little arrow next to OSM.gpkg You should be able to see the layers that are stored in the geopackage - as in the image above Select the multilinestrings layer in the Browser and drag and drop it into the Layers panel You may need to Zoom to layer to see what you have just added. It should be a few lines in a random colour. You can also add vector layers via the Data Source Manager Go to Layer > Data Source Manager Click on Vector on the left then click on the button with three dots next to the Source box Navigate to the OSM.gpkg file and select it Click on Open (If you\u2019re using a newer version of QGIS you\u2019ll also need to click on Add ) You\u2019ll get a choice of vector layers to add - select the points layer Then click on OK , and then on Close The new layer will be added to your Layers panel and you should see a lot of randomly coloured point symbols on your map. Removing layers Your map is looking rather a mess now, so let\u2019s clear it up a bit. You won\u2019t need the GBOverview, points and multilinestrings layers for the rest of this exercise so they can be removed . Note that removing layers from your map does just that. You are not deleting the data from your disk, they still exist, but you are removing the link between the map and your data. Right-click on the points layer (it may appear as OSM points ) Remove layer... You\u2019ll be asked to confirm that you want to remove the layer, click on OK Repeat the process with the multilinestrings and GBOverview layers. The process is identical for raster and vector layers. Ordering the layers in the Layers panel The order of the layers in the Layers panel affects how they appear on the map. Layers at the top of the list appear on top of the layers lower down. At the moment you probably have the raster-25 layer above the other layers, so you can\u2019t see them at the moment - though the labels still appear. Drag and drop the raster-25k layer from the top of the list in the Layers panel to the bottom. Again, your map will look rather a mess. Just make the following layers invisible for now. Places Line features Polygon features Tidal water You will be working with this map for the rest of the course so go to the correct area by using Type to locate to find Llanbedr Airfield . Saving your map Save your map projects at regular intervals. You will be doing a lot of work on them and can lose a lot of time if you have to do your work again because the program has crashed. Project > Save or alternatively Ctrl + S (Windows) If this is the first time you\u2019ve saved it, make sure you remember where you have saved it to and give the file a name which will help you remember what it is. It is a good idea to save all of your files to the same gis folder and make sub folders for each individual project. It is also a good idea to keep back up copies of your project and of the data files. Particularly once you start editing, problems can corrupt the whole file, so make a copy of your gis folder on a separate disk/drive/usb stick each time you finish a session working on them. Checking and setting the coordinate system The coordinate system is an important property which tells QGIS where data is located on the surface of the Earth and what measurement system is used for your datasets. It is important to have this set correctly or the layers in your map will not display correctly. If you are working in Great Britain then the coordinate system is most likely to be British National Grid, though you may also have data in the unprojected WGS 1984. For this project we will be working in British National Grid . QGIS will set the coordinate system of the map to that of the first data layer that is added. In this case it was the Places layer. Check whether the coordinate system is set correctly as follows: Go to Project > Properties and click on the CRS heading to the left This rather complex-looking dialog controls the CRS or Coordinate Reference System for the whole project. Look at the box to the left of the map - this shows that the CRS is currently set to British National Grid. The map on the right confirms that this CRS covers the correct area. It is possible to use the Filter box at the top to search for other coordinate systems, though this isn\u2019t necessary for this project. Click OK to close the project properties. If you look at the bottom right of the map window you should also see that the CRS is shown there, but this time only as a short numerical code - EPSG:27700 . If you click on this you will be taken to the CRS tab of the project properties. The final map for this chapter You should finish this chapter with a map of the Llanbedr Airfield on the Welsh coast. Your map and the rest of the project should look something like the image below, though your map may cover a slightly different area. It isn\u2019t a problem if it does. If you want me to give you feedback on this map, or on any stage of the process, please upload a screenshot to your GIS Portfolio - you\u2019ll be given instructions on how to get access to this in the class. If you upload anything please email me to let me know that you have done so. Don\u2019t forget to save and backup this project. You\u2019ll be using it for the rest of this course so make sure that you have it with you next week. Further information and suggested reading Many of the books in the reading list 3 have a general introduction to GIS which explain what it is and how it is used. Suggestions include the following: Chapter 1, What is GIS? in Heywood, I., Cornelius, S. and Carver, S. (2011), pp. 2-30 Chapter 1, Systems, Science and Study in Longley, P.A. et al. (2011), pp. 3-37 What is GIS? and some example applications ESRI UK (who publish proprietry GIS software ArcGIS) have a web page which includes an Overview of GIS and a GIS Showcase which includes examples of how GIS can be used. The webpage GIS for Science gives a lot more ideas for how GIS can be used by scientists. 7-zip is also open-source so if you want to install a copy on your own Windows computer you can - just download it from the 7-zip webpage . \u21a9 Note that these instructions are for Windows, if you are on a Mac or Linux computer you will still need to unzip the files, but I don\u2019t have access to one of these to write the instructions. \u21a9 The reading list is available in Minerva and from the library (search for the number of this module). \u21a9","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction-to-gis-with-qgis","text":"The background to GIS and an explanation of what it is will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

It won\u2019t look great at this zoom level, but you can use the Zoom in button, or the middle mouse button, to see it more clearly. These two new layers are raster data types. Again, you\u2019ll find out more about these later.","title":"Adding raster data to a map with the Data Source Manager"},{"location":"introduction/#adding-vector-data-to-a-map","text":"The vector files on this map are all stored in a Geopackage called OSM.gpkg . This is a form of database which stores and retrieves spatial data efficiently. If you look at this in File Explorer you\u2019ll note that it looks like a single file. If you look at it in the Browser in QGIS you\u2019ll see there is a little arrow next to it - the advantage of using the browser is that it is specifically designed to work with spatial data. Drop down the little arrow next to OSM.gpkg You should be able to see the layers that are stored in the geopackage - as in the image above Select the multilinestrings layer in the Browser and drag and drop it into the Layers panel You may need to Zoom to layer to see what you have just added. It should be a few lines in a random colour. You can also add vector layers via the Data Source Manager Go to Layer > Data Source Manager Click on Vector on the left then click on the button with three dots next to the Source box Navigate to the OSM.gpkg file and select it Click on Open (If you\u2019re using a newer version of QGIS you\u2019ll also need to click on Add ) You\u2019ll get a choice of vector layers to add - select the points layer Then click on OK , and then on Close The new layer will be added to your Layers panel and you should see a lot of randomly coloured point symbols on your map.","title":"Adding vector data to a map"},{"location":"introduction/#removing-layers","text":"Your map is looking rather a mess now, so let\u2019s clear it up a bit. You won\u2019t need the GBOverview, points and multilinestrings layers for the rest of this exercise so they can be removed . Note that removing layers from your map does just that. You are not deleting the data from your disk, they still exist, but you are removing the link between the map and your data. Right-click on the points layer (it may appear as OSM points ) Remove layer... You\u2019ll be asked to confirm that you want to remove the layer, click on OK Repeat the process with the multilinestrings and GBOverview layers. The process is identical for raster and vector layers.","title":"Removing layers"},{"location":"introduction/#ordering-the-layers-in-the-layers-panel","text":"The order of the layers in the Layers panel affects how they appear on the map. Layers at the top of the list appear on top of the layers lower down. At the moment you probably have the raster-25 layer above the other layers, so you can\u2019t see them at the moment - though the labels still appear. Drag and drop the raster-25k layer from the top of the list in the Layers panel to the bottom. Again, your map will look rather a mess. Just make the following layers invisible for now.

You will be doing a lot of work on them and can lose a lot of time if you have to do your work again because the program has crashed. Project > Save or alternatively Ctrl + S (Windows) If this is the first time you\u2019ve saved it, make sure you remember where you have saved it to and give the file a name which will help you remember what it is. It is a good idea to save all of your files to the same gis folder and make sub folders for each individual project. It is also a good idea to keep back up copies of your project and of the data files. Particularly once you start editing, problems can corrupt the whole file, so make a copy of your gis folder on a separate disk/drive/usb stick each time you finish a session working on them.","title":"Saving your map"},{"location":"introduction/#checking-and-setting-the-coordinate-system","text":"The coordinate system is an important property which tells QGIS where data is located on the surface of the Earth and what measurement system is used for your datasets. It is important to have this set correctly or the layers in your map will not display correctly. If you are working in Great Britain then the coordinate system is most likely to be British National Grid, though you may also have data in the unprojected WGS 1984. For this project we will be working in British National Grid . QGIS will set the coordinate system of the map to that of the first data layer that is added. In this case it was the Places layer. Check whether the coordinate system is set correctly as follows: Go to Project > Properties and click on the CRS heading to the left This rather complex-looking dialog controls the CRS or Coordinate Reference System for the whole project. Look at the box to the left of the map - this shows that the CRS is currently set to British National Grid. The map on the right confirms that this CRS covers the correct area. It is possible to use the Filter box at the top to search for other coordinate systems, though this isn\u2019t necessary for this project. Click OK to close the project properties. If you look at the bottom right of the map window you should also see that the CRS is shown there, but this time only as a short numerical code - EPSG:27700 . If you click on this you will be taken to the CRS tab of the project properties.","title":"Checking and setting the coordinate system"},{"location":"introduction/#the-final-map-for-this-chapter","text":"You should finish this chapter with a map of the Llanbedr Airfield on the Welsh coast.

If you want me to give you feedback on this map, or on any stage of the process, please upload a screenshot to your GIS Portfolio - you\u2019ll be given instructions on how to get access to this in the class.

Important Please be aware that it is essential for this module that you have access to particular GIS software - QGIS. The full instructions are below. Make sure that you have followed these instructions as soon as possible and confirmed that you have access to the software. You will need to start using QGIS in the class in week 7, and will not be able to progress with the exercises without it. If you have problems installing or accessing QGIS for any reason please contact me immediately so that I can help you - c.e.gordon@leeds.ac.uk Installing QGIS on your own computer This is the preferred method of using QGIS. If at all possible you should install it on your own computer as the version in the Virtual Windows Desktop is rather out of date. Instructions for using the Virtual Windows Desktop follow this section just in case you do need to use it. QGIS is Open Source Software which can be downloaded for Windows, Mac and Linux and is freely available from the QGIS web page Which version? QGIS maintains a Long term release (LTR) version as well as the latest version. At the moment the latest is version 3.16.0 and the long term release is version 3.10.11. I would advise that you install the latest version, but you can complete all of the work for this module using the LTR and that is the more stable version. So either are fine. Go to the QGIS Download page and go to the section for your operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux). If you are on Windows download one of the Standalone Installer versions rather than the Network Installer. If your computer is Windows 10 you should download the 64 bit version. Install the appropriate version following the usual method for your operating system, then make sure that you start QGIS to check that it works. If the installation is successful you should be able to see something like the screen below. Let me know if it does or doesn\u2019t work Please email me, Clare Gordon when you have successfully opened QGIS. Also email me if you can\u2019t get it to work. Once you have QGIS working you are set up and ready for the first class. You don\u2019t need to look at or follow the next set of instructions unless you are unable to install QGIS on your own computer. Using QGIS on the Virtual Windows Desktop From April 2020 it is possible to log in to a Virtual Windows Desktop to use QGIS. The Virtual Desktop will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. You need to install a client on your machine for the best access though it is apparently possible to run it in a web browser. Note that QGIS may not necessarily work via a web browser so the desktop client is preferred. Warning Note that the version of QGIS on the VWD is out of date, version 3.6 rather than a minimum of 3.10. Some plugins will not install or run, which will have an effect on completing the exercises for this module. If you are unable to install the software for some reason, this is the best way to access QGIS. Please make sure that you read all of the information in the IT knowledge base article about the Virtual Windows Desktop before you go ahead with this: Direct link to information about downloading and installing the VWD The important things to note are that capacity is limited, so if you can install QGIS on your own computer using the instructions above, please do so. again, capacity is limited, so if you do access QGIS by this route, make sure that you log off the Virtual Desktop when you have finished with it. GIS can very slowly in the Virtual Desktop if your data is on your M: drive. To get around this, copy your data to the Desktop, work on it, then copy it back to either your M: drive, or OneDrive . Data on the Desktop is deleted when you log out of the Virtual Desktop, or are timed out. Warning If you copy your data to the Virtual Desktop it is essential that you remember to then copy it back to either your M: drive or OneDrive before you log out. If you don\u2019t, you will lose the work that you have been doing. I will try to remind you of this at regular intervals during the exercises. When you have installed the virtual desktop client and opened it you should have an icon showing a computer with Academic written underneath. Click on the icon to open the actual desktop. Be patient as it is a bit slow. You\u2019ll be asked to log in with your usual University username and password. Once it has loaded your screen will be filled by a new desktop (your usual one is still there in the background). You\u2019ll need to double-click on an icon labelled AppsAnywhere Portal which opens a list of software Look for QGIS and click on Launch Hopefully QGIS will open, but again, it could be rather slow. Getting help with installation If you have problems you will need to contact the IT helpdesk - check you are logged on to Minerva then go to IT Services and log either an issue or a request. For an issue or problem go to Something broken? and fill in the form For a general request go to Request Something then Log a general Request and fill in the form.","title":"Access to software for GIS exercises"},{"location":"software/software/#access-to-software-for-gis-exercises","text":"Last Modified: 05 Nov 20, 12:50:32 These instructions only apply to students and staff at the University of Leeds.
