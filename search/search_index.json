The lecture segment should help you to understand why you are doing these exercises. If you still aren\u2019t sure, please ask Clare . Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate the use of symbology to analyse and display data on a map select appropriate tools to carry out geoprocessing tasks in GIS in order to answer specific questions Introduction This chapter continues working with the Llanbedr, North Wales map project, so open that in QGIS now if it isn\u2019t already open. Now that you have the point data in QGIS you can start to analyse it and display it to answer questions. Raster and vector If you feel that you are still not clear about the difference between raster and vector GIS data it would be worth watching the video \u201c Learn more about raster and vector map data \u201d by the Ordnance Survey before you start on this chapter. Using symbols and labels to analyse data We\u2019ll start by seeing what we can do to analyse the data by displaying it on a map. In this way you can sometimes pick up patterns in the data. Styling the point layer Open the Layer Styling panel for the LlanbedrGravity layer ( View > Panels and tick next to Layer Styling or the button at the top left of the Layers panel - remember that tool tips will show if you hover over a button.) Make sure you are on the Symbology tab. At the top drop down where it says Single Symbol and select Graduated Set the Value to CorrBA At the bottom of the panel select Classify Your points should now have a range of colours - the key in the Layers panel shows the range of values that these indicate. There are a lot of settings in the Layer styling panel. For example you can change the colour ramp or you can change the intervals by changing Mode and number of Classes . You can change the class values manually by double-clicking in the Values column and filling in new Lower or Upper values. It is also possible to change the Method to show graduated size instead of graduated colour. Try clicking on Load Values in the Histogram tab and have a look at how your data values are distributed. Displaying your point data Try out some of the settings in the Layer styling panel and see how they can help you to display and interpret your data. How well do you think this works for this data set? Use your knowledge as a scientist to display this data in a suitable manner using these tools. Sometimes turning off the background layer can help you to see the styles and labels. Don\u2019t forget to turn it back on again later, though. If you\u2019re not happy with your symbology remember that it is always possible to remove the layer from your map then add it back in again and start from scratch. Labelling the point layer Another way of displaying the data is to add labels to the points which show the actual values. In the Layer Styling panel go to the Labels tab (remember to hover over buttons or tabs to use tool tips) Drop down No Labels and choose Single Labels instead Set the Value to CorrBA and the labels should appear on your map. Again, play with the settings. You have already tried out labelling polygons in the chapter on Creating data , now you have a chance to find out more about labelling points. Change the font and the font size on the Text tab. You don\u2019t want these labels to be too large - they need to be visible but shouldn\u2019t dominate the map. How do the Placement settings (one of the tabs at the top of the panel - use the tooltips to find it again) affect the labels? Try setting the Mode to Cartographic then increase the Distance of the label from the feature. When you are happy with the symbols and the labels save your map and continue. Creating a raster surface from your point data At the moment you have data in point format. That gives measurements for particular locations, but what happens if you want to know the measurement at a location between the samples? This is where GIS analysis becomes essential. Highest and lowest values Before you start have a look at the LlanbedrGravity layer and make a note of the highest and lowest values in the CorrBA field. You can do this either from the labels, or from the attribute table. QGIS can create a surface in raster format which is derived from point data. This will show z values for the spaces between the observed points which QGIS processing tools will have worked out from available data - a process known as interpolation . Inevitably the accuracy of the surface will increase if you have more data points in a particular area, but it still works if your points are widely spaced. There are a couple of different methods of interpolation available in QGIS. The instructions below use IDW (Inverse Distance Weighted) as an example, but you\u2019ll get a chance to have a look at an alternative. Different methods work best for different data. ESRI, who make the ArcGIS software that we\u2019re not using, have an article entitled Interpolating Surfaces in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst . Whilst that refers to their software not to QGIS, the principles are the same. Have a look at the article and their discussion of IDW and Spline amongst others. The analysis tools in QGIS are available in the Processing Toolbox . Open the toolbox by going to Processing > Toolbox The Processing Toolbox should open to the right of your map. There are a choice of tool providers in the toolbox. Depending on your settings you should see a series of QGIS logos denoting native QGIS tools, but there may also be GDAL, GRASS and SAGA. Warning While you may appear to have GRASS and SAGA available, sometimes these need to be enabled correctly before they will actually work. For more information about the processing framework see the page in the QGIS User Guide . To use the tools: Start by searching for IDW in the box at the top of the toolbox Several options should appear, double-click on the one under the QGIS Interpolation heading called IDW interpolation Fill in the dialog as follows The Vector layer input is your LlanbedrGravity layer - you should be able to find it by dropping down the list of layers The Interpolation attribute is the field holding the data - in this case it\u2019s CorrBA , again use the dropdown to find it Click on the plus button underneath to add your input to the list. Click on the button next to the Extent field and select Use Layer Extent... then select the LlanbedrGravity layer as the extent Set the Pixel size x and y to 5.0 . You can set it lower, e.g. to 2, but the size of the output file will be larger, and it will take longer for the tool to run. at the bottom choose where to save the output - I usually create a subfolder of the project folder called output then save all the raster data there Give your output a short name which will tell you what it contains, e.g. IDWgrav Click on Run and wait for the process to finish - it can take a while The Close the window. Your new layer should be automatically added to your map. If it isn\u2019t, drag it there from the Browser now. The tool will have interpolated the surface from your data points. You should end up with something similar, but probably not identical, to the picture below. If your point labels are showing through feel free to turn off the LlanbedrGravity layer for now. It will make it easier to work with the surface. Looking at your data If you look at the Layers panel you\u2019ll be able to see the low and high measurements for the surface that you\u2019ve just generated. Do these measurements make sense in terms of the low and high of your original data? If you look at the ESRI article on interpolation does that help you to understand why the surface may or may not vary from your data? Change the symbology of the raster surface QGIS has used a default black to white colour ramp to display the gravity surface but it should be possible to find a more successful symbology for this raster layer. Select your new IDW layer in the Layers panel and open the Layer Styling panel if it isn\u2019t already open. Use the dropdown to change Singleband gray to Singleband pseudocolor . Your layer will disappear. Drop down the Min / Max Value Settings and check that Min/max is ticked. Interpolation should be set to Linear Drop down the Color ramp and go to All Color Ramps > RdBu - this should be Red to Blue. Click on the Color ramp again, and this time select Invert Color Ramp - in general blue is seen as low and red as high so that fits this data better. QGIS will display your gravity surface again. Add mGal as the Label unit suffix - you will probably want to put a space before it. Change Label precision to 2 Then click Apply to apply those settings to the entry in the Layers panel. Setting transparency for a raster layer At the moment your surface is fine for the colours, but it is covering up the background map. You need to make that visible so that it is possible to see where measurements are located. In the Layer Styling panel click on the second tab down on the left - Transparency Use the Global Opacity slider to make the layer transparent. Try setting it to something like 80% Play with the slider until you are happy that your layer is suitably transparent so that the background layer shows through but the raster surface is still clear. Trying out a different method of interpolation There are multiple methods of interpolation but QGIS has a relatively limited choice. Kriging is only available under the SAGA library in QGIS and that doesn\u2019t appear to be installed by default so I don\u2019t cover it here. For spline the best option is part of the GRASS toolbox, which should be installed. If the toolbox isn\u2019t already open go to Processing > Toolbox search for v.surf.rst - this will generate an interpolated map by splines (rst = Regularised splines with tension) The form for this does look rather complex but you don\u2019t need to fill in most of the choices. Set the Input points layer to LlanbedrGravity The Name of the attribute column... is CorrBA Then go down to the Advanced parameters and set GRASS GIS 7 region cellsize to 5 (the cellsize is basically the resolution of the resulting raster layer) Then go down again to Interpolated RST [optional] - this is the output file. Click on the three dots button to the right and Save to file... Choose where to save the file and give it a name, e.g. RSTgrav.tif then Save Check that there is a tick in the box next to Open output file after running algorithm Then change all of the dropdown boxes below to [Skip output] to prevent those being created Then click on Run I haven\u2019t put an image for the whole of this form as it won\u2019t fit on one page, but the image below shows the output section and the setting to save the Interpolated RST output, but none of the other layers. You may get quite a few red error messages while it runs - partly because we don\u2019t have a large number of points to base the interpolation on. But QGIS should then add a new layer to your map. Follow the same instructions to symbolise this output as you did the IDW output and make it transparent Looking at your data If you look at the Layers panel you\u2019ll be able to see the low and high measurements for the RST surface that you\u2019ve just generated. Do these measurements make sense in terms of the low and high of your original data? If you look at the ESRI article on interpolation does that help you to understand why the surface may or may not vary from your data? Comparing the raster surfaces You can compare the values of each surface at various points by using the Identify Features tool from the Attributes toolbar. Make sure that the IDW and RST layers are both visible, and turn off all of the other layers in the map Check that the Attributes toolbar is visible by going to View > Toolbars and checking that there is a tick next to it. Click on the Identify features button (highlighted in the image above) Then click somewhere on your map and select Identify All (2) The Identify Results window should pop up showing a tree view of the value of the two layers at that point as Band 1 . Click in a few places and see how the values compare Which surface do you think is the most appropriate for this data? Have another look at the ESRI article on Interpolating Surfaces in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst . Think about which surface you think is most appropriate for the data you have here and use that surface for the rest of the exercises in this workbook. Keep a note of why you have chosen the surface that you have as you\u2019ll need to include this explanation in the layout for the assessment at the end of this workbook. Once you have decided which layer to use remove the other from your map and turn the raster-25k_3706482 layer back on so that it is visible. Deriving contours from a surface Once you have created a surface it is easy to derive contours to display the surface in 2D. This can make patterns in the data more obvious. If the toolbox isn\u2019t already open go to Processing > Toolbox Search for Contour You should find the correct tool under GDAL > Raster extraction > Contour . Double-click on it to open. Fill in the form as follows: The Input layer is the raster surface that you\u2019ve chosen to use, e.g. I\u2019ve used IDWgrav in the example. The Interval between contour lines depends on your data. Look at the highest and lowest values and think what might be a reasonable interval. If it doesn\u2019t look good first time it\u2019s easy to run the tool again. I\u2019ve chosen to enter 1 . Under Contours click on the three dots button on the right Click on Save to file... Navigate to the folder in which you want to save your data. Choose GPKG files (*.gpkg) as the Save as type: and give your output a name, such as Contours1.gpkg (the \u201c1\u201d will show the contour interval) and Save . Note that unfortunately this tool won\u2019t add the output to an existing geopackage. Click on Run QGIS should then generate contours and add them as a layer to your map. Use the Layer styling panel to set the contours to a suitable colour and thickness. They should be visible on your map, but not stand out too much. This is a map people will be looking at in close up, not a poster. Sizing symbols to the output scale Try setting the scale of the map to 1:25000 (the scale you\u2019ll be using for the output) then in the layer styling panel set the Unit to Map Units , which in this case are metres. You\u2019ll then be able to control how the Width of the line appears at that scale as that unit \u201con the ground\u201d. If the Unit is set to a measurement, such as pixels, then the lines stay the same width on the screen whatever your zoom level. Try it out and see. Adding labels to contours Contours for any surface don\u2019t help much if you don\u2019t know the value of each of them. QGIS is able to label features in a map with any field from the attribute table, as you saw in the exercises on digitising data . Right-click on your contours layer in the contents pane and select to Open Attribute Table . What is the name of the field that shows the height of each contour? The attribute table will show the information, or attributes, about the features in this layer and should enable you to see which field holds the height, or elevation, data. To add labels to your contours do the following: In the Layer styling panel click on the Labels tab on the left. Check that you have your contours layer selected at the top Drop down the list where it currently says No Labels and select Single Labels instead In the Value field select the field you made a note of above. The one which contains your heights. In my case this field is ELEV The labels will appear on your map, but they are too big, too black and not on top of the lines! Use the settings in the various tabs of the Layer styling panel to make the labels smaller - they need to be readable, but not to dominate the map. Again, you can change the units to Map Units to have more control over the size when printed. change the font if you think a different font would be clearer make the labels a paler colour use the Placement tab to move the labels On line You could also try labelling your data points, if you think that it would be useful to someone else looking at your map. Output from this chapter The example below shows the possible output from this chapter. Your layout should look different. You will have made your own decisions about what to include and how to symbolise and label your data. You\u2019ll learn more about layouts in a future chapter and will get a chance to apply those techniques to this map to produce a professional-looking map layout. Save your map project for next week Keep this North Wales map project safely as you\u2019ll need it for future chapters and for the module assessment. More information: Analysis in GIS There is more about data analysis in GIS in the module reading list 1 . In particular have a look at the following: Heywood, Cornelius and Carver (2011) chapter 6 on page 174 and following. Longley et al. (2015) Part III is all about analysis, but in particular have a look at chapter 13 on page 290 and following. More information on techniques in QGIS The QGIS Training Manual includes a lot of information on both vector analysis and raster analysis in QGIS. If you are looking for ideas of how to use QGIS with your data in future this is a key resource. If you prefer to learn from videos then Hans van der Kwast from the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education has a very good range on YouTube . His main interest is hydrology but the techniques he uses will work for other data too. He also has GIS OpenCourseWare for Hydrological Applications online which provide a lot of resources for learning GIS with QGIS.

The lecture segment should help you to understand why you are doing these exercises. If you still aren\u2019t sure, please ask Clare . Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to Demonstrate how to find BGS data in Digimap and download data for a particular area. Explain how to add BGS geological data to GIS and symbolise the data using BGS standard symbols/colours imported from an external style file. Introduction It is possible to download shapefiles containing British Geological Survey (BGS) data at various scales from the Digimap service. These can be added to GIS in the usual way. Once data has been added to a map symbolising the data can be an issue. This chapter gives you some suggestions for how to display the data. Please refer to the Digimap chapter of these exercises for more information about how to use the Digimap download services. Data to download Log in to Digimap and download tiles of geological data in shapefile format for the area below from the Geology Data Download section . You should download 1:50 000 Geology from the Onshore Geology section of the menu. Unfortunately 1:25 000 data is not available for this area but a 1:50 000 map will be sufficient for our purposes. Once you have downloaded the zip file containing your data save it to the folder with the rest of the data for this map then unzip it . Remember you can\u2019t use data in QGIS until it has been unzipped. Downloading style files Digimap also provide style files so that you can use standard colours for the layers in the geology data that they provide. While you are in Digimap return to the home page and click on Resources at the top right Scroll down the resource centre page and look under Help by Service Click on Geology Digimap Help Next click on Using map data with GIS in the left-hand menu Then click on Geology Colour Schemes This page gives links to style files for use with a range of BGS data and in a range of GIS software. For the data and GIS that you are using download 1:50,000 Scale QML.zip and save it in your GIS folder. Unzip the downloaded folder - you should end up with a folder containing several files with an extension of .qml . You will be using this file later so remember where you saved it to. Warning The bedrock style file is missing a key rock type for this area. Please go to Minerva and download the gb_50k_bedrock.zip file from the week 9 section. Unzip it and replace the downloaded gb_50k.qml file with the one you download from Minerva before following the instructions below. Adding BGS data to your map The geological data from Digimap is provided in shapefile format in tiles which match the printed map sheets . Luckily the area we are working on is covered by a single sheet - sheet 135 for Harlech. If your North Wales map isn\u2019t already open in QGIS, open it now. Find the unzipped bgs-50k folder in your Browser panel and have a look at the contents of the ew135 folder. The name refers to the map sheet number and England and Wales. You should see that the Harlech area has three shapefiles containing data. These cover bedrock geology, linear geology and superficial geology. Some sheets also have other layers. Note that these layers will cover a larger area than the rest of your map layers - this doesn\u2019t matter. When you create a layout you will set the view so that you only see the area you actually want and anything outside of that just won\u2019t be seen. Add all three of these layers to your map by dragging them into the Layers panel Group the geology layers by selecting all three and right-clicking Select to Group Selected then give the group a name like Geology . Once the layers are grouped you\u2019ll be able to move them around together, or turn them on and off just by clicking next to the group heading. Drag and drop the layers as necessary in the Layers panel so that they are in the order shown in the image below Have a look at the attribute table for the ew135_harlech_bedrock layer The attribute table has a lot of columns and looks rather confusing. If you want to know more about the data the user guide is available as part of your download from Digimap - look in the bgs-50k > docs folder for the User_Guide_BGS_Geology...pdf file. By default the data will be symbolised as single symbols and in random colours. You\u2019ve seen previously how to set up categories for colours and symbology, but having seen the attribute table you\u2019ll realise that doing that for these datasets would be time consuming. Don\u2019t worry - there is an easy way! Using style files in QGIS Earlier you downloaded the QGIS style files to match the 1:50 000 data from Digimap. If you haven\u2019t already unzipped the download file 50k_qml.zip make sure that you unzip it to the same folder as your Llanbedr map and data. Warning The bedrock style file is missing a key rock type for this area. If you haven\u2019t already please go to Minerva and download the gb_50k_bedrock.zip file from the week 9 section. Unzip it and replace the previously downloaded gb_50k_bedrock.qml file with the one you download from Minerva before following the instructions below. Either double-click on the ew135_harlech_bedrock layer in the Layers panel or right-click and select Properties . You can\u2019t import styles from the Layer styling panel. Go to the Symbology tab of the properties At the bottom left of the symbology is a button which says Style . Click on this button and select Load Style... This opens the Database Styles Manager . Make sure that Load style is set to From File Click on the three dots button next to File and navigate to where you unzipped your qml files Select the file called gb_50k_bedrock.qml (i.e. the one which matches the file you need to symbolise) and click Open Back in the Database Styles Manager click on Load Style You may have to wait a bit at this stage - QGIS is loading a lot of styles for this layer. The Symbology menu should change to Categorized and show you a long list of Symbols and values. Now click on OK and the Bedrock layer should be symbolised. Again, you might have to wait for a while for this to happen. If it looks a bit as if QGIS is going to crash at any point it\u2019s worth just waiting - don\u2019t try clicking on anything as that will make it worse! You may not see the newly symbolised bedrock layer clearly at the moment as the superficial geology is covering a lot of the area. Make sure you save your map at this stage. Apply the style files to the superficial and linear geology Repeat the instructions above to apply the appropriate style files to the superficial and linear geology layers. You should have qml files called gb_50k_superficial_deposits.qml and gb_50k_linear.qml . Once you have applied all three style files to the relevant layers you should have a map which looks like the following image. This looks a lot better, but a geological map needs a background map showing places and other features of the location. Zoom in to 1:50 000 using the scale dropdown below the map Superficial geology isn\u2019t necessary on this map so turn off that layer or remove it from your map Turn off the raster_25k_3706482 layer - this is too detailed for a geological map at this scale Instead turn back on the Places , Line features , Polygon features and Tidal water layers. Make the ew135_harlech_bedrock layer transparent so that you can see the background layer through it.

Instead you can use the Identify tool. You saw how to use the identify tool to compare the raster surfaces in the Analysis chapter but I\u2019ll put the instructions here too to show you the tool in use for a vector layer. Select the ew135_harlech_bedrock layer in the Layers panel Check that the Attributes toolbar is visible by going to View > Toolbars and checking that there is a tick next to it. Click on the Identify features button (highlighted in the image above) Then click somewhere on your map and select ew135_harlech_bedrock (50000) The Identify Results window should pop up showing a tree view of the value of the bedrock geology layer. There is a lot of information here. Have a look down the list - this matches the attribute table that you looked at earlier in the chapter. Finding out the rock types Have a look at the information for several of the rock features on the map. Make a note of the age, formation name and age for some of them. This will be relevant to your description and explanation of the relationship between the gravity and the geology for the assessment. It\u2019s worth having a look at the linear features too.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to Set up storage for GIS data Use the tools in GIS to draw (digitise) your own data discuss the problems that can affect data for GIS suggest ways in which to minimize error and uncertainty in spatial data Introduction Digitising or tracing data manually in GIS involves having a background map which shows the locations that you wish to digitise, and then using the editing tools to draw vector polygons, lines and points. In this set of exercises you will produce a map of Chancellors Court in the University showing the outlines of the buildings, the paths, and the trees. You will already have a layer from the previous chapter which contains features such as sign posts, benches and rocks. Even if you don\u2019t actually need to digitise a map it is extremely useful to know how to set up your own feature classes and how to add features by editing. Sometimes you just need to outline your study area, or add a point to show where something specific is, or as input to one of the tools provided in Arc. This is a very brief overview of the tools for digitising in QGIS as we are limited for time. Vector and raster If you feel that you are not clear about the difference between raster and vector GIS data it would be worth having a look at the video \u201c Learn more about raster and vector map data \u201d by the Ordnance Survey. As you deal with more GIS data you\u2019ll start to find it easier to spot which formats are raster and which are vector, but you need to be thinking about it already. Obtaining the data You should still have the British National Grid version of the project from the GPS chapter. You will be adding more data to this project. If you no longer have this project you can start a new project from scratch instead, but you won\u2019t have the gps points on the map when you have finished. You will also need to download the DigitiseDataQ.zip file from Minerva unzip the file to the same folder as the Chancellors Court map. You should end up with a folder called getmapping_rgb_25cm which contains aerial imagery of the University 1 . The jpg file contains the image and the other files with it which have a similar name contain information that will locate it correctly within GIS. Open the map project Start by opening the British National Grid version of your Chancellors Court map. (You may need to accept the transform when you do.) From the files you downloaded and unzipped add se2934_rgb_250_01.jpg to your map using the Browser. (You may need to look in sub folders to find the file.) Turn off the waypoints, location and OSM Monochrome layers so they don\u2019t get in the way. You should already have an aerial view of Chancellors Court on your map. You will use this as a basis to digitise the buildings, paths and trees. Setting up geopackage feature classes to store your data The first thing you need to do is set up the storage for the data that you are about to create. You already have a GeoPackage in your project, and you will use that to store this new data too. If you don\u2019t already have a geopackage or want to create a new one In the Browser right-click on the folder in which you want to store the new geopackage or geopackage layer. It\u2019s a good idea to use the Project Home folder if you have already saved your map. New > GeoPackage Give your new Geopackage a name in the Database field - don\u2019t delete the path to it, just change the name. If you already have a geopackage (which you should have in this case - if you followed my suggestions it is called University.gpkg ) In version 3.10 of QGIS In the Browser right-click on the existing geopackage Create a New Layer or Table... You won\u2019t have the choice of changing the geopackage name here In version 3.16 and above of QGIS Right click on the folder that contains your geopackage New > GeoPackage Browse to your existing geopackage Whether you are creating a new geopackage or using an existing one the instructions are the same from here: Fill in Table name with a name which will remind you what that table contains - in this case call it Buildings Choose a Geometry type - in this case Polygon (note that once this is set for a feature class you can\u2019t change it later) There is a drop down for the CRS (unlabelled) either drop that down and select Project CRS: EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid or use the button at the end of the line to search for the appropriate CRS. If you want to add any fields to contain attributes you can do so now - it is also possible to add fields later Under New Field type in a Name - in this case Label Choose a Type - for this layer choose Text data Then type a Maximum length - for now type in 250 - this is the maximum number of characters your label will be. Then click on the Add to Fields List button to add the new field to the list. You can then add more fields if you need to, but we don\u2019t at the moment. Once you\u2019ve added all of the fields click on OK to create the new feature class. If you are in version 3.16 and above it will ask whether you want to Overwrite the geopackage or create a new layer - click on Add new layer . The new feature class should be created in your GeoPackage and added to your map. If you can\u2019t see the new layer in the geopackage you may need to select the top level folder and then click on the Refresh button at the to of the Browser. If the new layer isn\u2019t added to your map drag it there from the Browser now. Creating two more feature classes Use the same instructions to create two further feature classes in the same geopackage. Note that the Geometry type is different this time and remember that you must set these correctly or you have to create the feature classes again. Create a Line feature class called Paths . This doesn\u2019t need any new fields. Create a Point feature class called Trees . Again, this doesn\u2019t need any new fields. Have a look at the new layers in your geopackage using the Browser. Note that the icons next to the layers show you what the Geometry type is. Digitising in QGIS You should already have an aerial view as a background for your map. For these exercises you will be digitising polygons, lines and points by tracing over features on this view. Before starting to digitise check that you have the Digitising Toolbar open. View > Toolbars Check that there is a tick next to Digitising Toolbar The toolbar should look something like this image at the moment. The only button available is Toggle Editing . Digitising polygons The Buildings feature class has a geometry type of Polygon , so this will hold closed shapes. We\u2019ll start by digitising polygons, but lines and points are actually very similar. Start by selecting the Buildings layer in the Layers panel Either right-click on the layer and click on Toggle Editing or click the Toggle Editing button on the Digitising toolbar. You should have more buttons available on the Digitising toolbar now. The button that I\u2019ve highlighted is Add Polygon Feature . Click on this so that you are ready to start tracing. We\u2019ll digitise the School of Earth and Environment (SEE) building by drawing around the outline on the aerial photograph. SEE is the building to the north of Chancellors Court 2 . Left-click on one corner of the SEE building, then on the next. Keep left-clicking until you have outlined the building. You can zoom in and out and pan as necessary (to pan easily hold down the mouse wheel and drag the map). As you progress around the shape you should see it as a transparent red with a stronger outline. Each click creates a vertex or node. If you want to delete the previous vertex that you placed, because it\u2019s not right, just press the Delete or Backspace keys on your keyboard. If you\u2019re not happy with the whole shape clicking on Esc will get rid of it completely. When you have placed a vertex on each corner of the building right-click to finish editing. Depending on the settings in your installation of QGIS you should find that a Features Attributes window opens. This gives you an opportunity to add attributes to your table. The buildings feature class has a Label attribute. Fill that in now with the name of the building - School of Earth and Environment . The fid (or Feature ID) is generated automatically so don\u2019t touch that. Click OK . To save your new feature to the geopackage make sure that you click on the Save Layer Edits button on the Digitising toolbar Your new feature should appear as a solid colour on your map. Continue on to digitise the buildings to the east, west and south of Chancellors Court. The map below shows the names of the buildings for you to add. When you have finished digitising and have saved your edits click on the Toggle Editing button again to finish. Styling your layer The previous chapter gave you instructions for styling your point layer . Use those instructions again to style your layer in a way that you think is suitable for your data. For example buildings are often styled as a pale brown colour. The original instructions apply to point symbols, polygons and lines are styled in a very similar way, so just have a go and see what you come up with. Transparency It can be useful to make your layers transparent . As you draw your building polygons you\u2019ll gradually be covering up the layers underneath and it can be useful to see through the top layers. Click on the Buildings layer in the Layers pane Then click on the button at top left of the Layers pane to Open the Layer Styling Panel The layer styling panel should open to the right of your map. Click on the Symbology tab in the icons on the left of the panel Make sure that the Fill is selected Use the Opacity slider to change the opacity or transparency of your layer. For example, slide it to about 70% Warning It is also possible to change the transparency by using the Opacity setting in the Layer Rendering section, but if you do that the features won\u2019t remain transparent when you export your map to pdf. Set the opacity so that you can see through your building polgons to the aerial imagery below. Data quality Think about data quality issues Stop and think about the digitising you have just done. Can you think of any potential issues with the data that you have created in this way? What scale did you digitise at? What effect will this have on the amount of detail that you included? What recommendation would you make about viewing the data on the map? How accurate were you when you were placing the vertices on the corners of the buildings? How clear were the edges of the building that you were digitising? What did you do when the edges were unclear, e.g. because of overlapping trees. What about shadows? Editing features If you want to edit a polygon or line to change it once you have created it you can. Click Toggle Edit on the toolbar (if you aren\u2019t already editing) Click on the Vertex tool on the digitising toolbar. Then right-click on the feature that you want to edit. The feature\u2019s vertices will become visible as small red circles or squares. Left-click on one of the vertices and you will be able to move it around. When the vertex is in the position that you want it just left-click again. When you\u2019ve finished editing right-click on the feature again to stop using the vertex tool. Don\u2019t forget to click on Save Layer Edits When you have done all of your edits click Toggle Edit again to stop editing. Deleting features If you want to delete a feature completely you can. Click Toggle Edit on the toolbar (if you aren\u2019t already editing) Look for Select Features by area or single click button on the toolbars (highlighted on the image of the Attributes toolbar below) Click on the feature that you want to delete - it should become highlighted in bright yellow Press Delete on your keyboard Don\u2019t forget to click on Save Layer Edits When you have done all of your edits click Toggle Edit again to stop editing. Labelling features As you added features to your feature class you also added the Label attribute. You can now use this to label the features on your map. Click on the Buildings layer in the Layers pane Then click on the button at top left of the Layers pane to Open the Layer Styling Panel if it isn\u2019t already open. The layer styling panel should open to the right of your map. Click on the Label tab on the left. At the moment it will just say No labels . Drop down where it says No labels and select Single labels At this stage QGIS usually just labels your features with the first field in the feature class, which at the moment is fid . This isn\u2019t very useful so the first thing you need to do is select the correct field. Next to Value drop down the choices and select the Label field. Immediately the building names that you added should appear on your map on top of the correct buildings. The default fonts, colours and placements are not always what you want. In fact, usually just accepting the defaults is not a good idea. Use the settings on the first of the tabs (Text) to change the font, font size and colour Click on the Placement tab and select Horizontal from the Mode dropdown list. Note that in QGIS 3.10 you need to click on the button next to Horizontal (slow) . This should move your labels to within the polygon shapes. Feel free to try out the properties in the other tabs too. There are lots of choices to help you make your labels clear and informative. Digitising Line features Digitising line features is very similar to digitising polygons, except that you don\u2019t have to finish where you started. You should already have a Paths layer in your Layer panel. If you haven\u2019t then drag it across from the geopackage. Some of the paths on this map are curved rather than straight. The easiest way of drawing curved lines in QGIS is to click more often. On tight curves you do have to click a lot to make the line look curved. There are more advanced editing tools which would help, but this is only a quick overview so you can explore them if you want to, but this way of drawing is fine for now. Select the Paths layer, toggle editing and click on the Add line feature button Add lines for the paths across Chancellors Court. You don\u2019t need to add any labels for this layer. Save your edits and toggle editing off. Think about data quality Again, think about the problems that you encounter as you edit. Do you draw the edges of the paths, or just the centre line? How can you be sure of what happens underneath trees? How easy is it to be accurate with the drawing tools? Think about the implications for future use of the map at different scales. Digitising Point features Digitising point features is very similar to digitising polygons, except that you only have to click once for each point. You should already have a Trees layer in your Layer panel. If you haven\u2019t then drag it across from the geopackage. Select the Trees layer, toggle editing and click on the Add point feature button Add a point for each tree in Chancellors Court. You don\u2019t need to add any labels for this layer. Save your edits and toggle editing off. Think about data quality Again, think about the problems that you encounter as you edit. How easy is it to decide where you should add a point to represent a tree? How easy is it to be accurate with the drawing tools? Think about the implications for future use of the map at different scales. Finally Finish digitising the buildings around Chancellors Court, the paths across it, and the trees. Check that all of the layers that you have created - the points, lines and polygons, have been symbolised appropriately and are labelled where necesary. Turn off the Aerial image by unticking the box next to it in the Layers panel If you want to, turn the symbolised waypoints layer back on Make sure that all of the features on your digitised layers are visible in the map window. You should export your map from QGIS as an image and upload it to your GIS Portfolio. If you upload it within a week of the class I will give you feedback on your work. When you are happy with your map go to Project > Import / Export > Export Map to Image In the Save Map as Image dialog set the extent by clicking on the Map Canvas Extent button Click on Save In a later chapter you\u2019ll find out how to create a full map layout with a key, scale bar, measured grid etc and print or export that properly, but for now this is fine and will enable me to give you feedback on your use of the tools you have been introduced to today. In the next chapter you\u2019ll be working on the North Wales map and you won\u2019t need this Chancellors Court map again. Further information and suggested reading Many of the books in the reading list 3 have a general introduction to GIS which explain what it is and how it is used. Suggestions include the following: Chapter 5, Data input and editing in Heywood, I., Cornelius, S. and Carver, S. (2011), pp.135-173 covers the background to a variety of ways of inputting data to GIS and discusses data quality issues. Chapter 8, Data Collection in Longley, P.A. et al. (2015), pp.173 onwards. Again this chapter covers the background to a variety of ways of collecting data and inputting it to GIS. Section 8.3.2 from page 183 covers Vector Data Capture, or digitising. The QGIS Documentation has a chapter on the techniques of Editing which covers much more than we have been able to cover here. The information about Digitising an existing layer covers the topics in this chapter, but there is plenty more there. Digitising an existing layer for v. 3.10 of QGIS Digitising an existing layer for v. 3.16 of QGIS There are a lot of videos on YouTube which may help you. Try searching for Digitising QGIS . This data was downloaded from Aerial Digimap. \u21a9 If you\u2019ve lost Chancellors Court in your map remember that you have the LocationBNG layer in your map from the previous chapter. You can Zoom to Layer on that to get back to the right area. \u21a9 The reading list is available in Minerva and from the library (search for the number of this module). \u21a9","title":"Creating data by digitising"},{"location":"creating_data/#creating-data-by-digitising","text":"The background to data for GIS will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

In this set of exercises you will produce a map of Chancellors Court in the University showing the outlines of the buildings, the paths, and the trees. You will already have a layer from the previous chapter which contains features such as sign posts, benches and rocks. Even if you don\u2019t actually need to digitise a map it is extremely useful to know how to set up your own feature classes and how to add features by editing. Sometimes you just need to outline your study area, or add a point to show where something specific is, or as input to one of the tools provided in Arc. This is a very brief overview of the tools for digitising in QGIS as we are limited for time. Vector and raster If you feel that you are not clear about the difference between raster and vector GIS data it would be worth having a look at the video \u201c Learn more about raster and vector map data \u201d by the Ordnance Survey.

The QGIS Documentation has a chapter on the techniques of Editing which covers much more than we have been able to cover here. The information about Digitising an existing layer covers the topics in this chapter, but there is plenty more there. Digitising an existing layer for v. 3.10 of QGIS Digitising an existing layer for v. 3.16 of QGIS There are a lot of videos on YouTube which may help you. Try searching for Digitising QGIS . This data was downloaded from Aerial Digimap. \u21a9 If you\u2019ve lost Chancellors Court in your map remember that you have the LocationBNG layer in your map from the previous chapter. You can Zoom to Layer on that to get back to the right area. \u21a9 The reading list is available in Minerva and from the library (search for the number of this module). \u21a9","title":"Further information and suggested reading"},{"location":"finding_data/","text":"Finding spatial data to use in GIS The background to finding data will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate that you can find suitable data for GIS projects from a variety of sources describe the main types of data used in GIS acknowledge the data that you use in your maps in a suitable fashion Introduction Being able to find, download and prepare your own data is an essential part of using GIS. While the data will be provided for you for many of the exercises in this module, you will find it useful to have some idea of where the data comes from, and what there is available for you to use for your own maps. While downloading shouldn\u2019t take too long, don\u2019t leave it until the last minute before you have to produce a map. Websites can become unavailable either permanently or temporarily, or computers can crash. Digimap Digimap is a service provided to Higher Education in the U.K. by EDINA at Edinburgh University. Digimap provides a front end to digital maps and data of Great Britain from the Ordnance Survey and British Geological Survey, amongst others. The University of Leeds subscribes to the collections and as a student you have access to maps and data for use as part of your studies. Logging in to Digimap If you have not used Digimap before you will need to register and log in using your University ID, that is the username and password that you use to access University systems such as Minerva. Full instructions for logging in are on the Digimap help pages . Go to the Digimap Collections page at https://digimap.edina.ac.uk Click the Log in button at the top right of the screen type Leeds in the box and select University of Leeds from the list of available institutions You should get the familiar University of Leeds log in page, so type your University username and password into the appropriate boxes and then click the Log in button. If you are already logged in to Minerva you may find that you don\u2019t have to enter your login details again. If this is the first time that you\u2019ve logged in to Digimap you\u2019ll be asked to register for each collection separately, though you can do all at one go. You won\u2019t need to use all of the collections during this module, but it\u2019s worth registering for all that are available to you so that you can explore them for yourself. The University does not subscribe to Marine or Global Digimap. Go through the list of collections, read and accept the conditions for each one, selecting Academic Works (coursework, projects, dissertations etc.) in the Purpose dropdown for each. Once you submit all of those you should be taken to the Digimap initial page again, as shown below, but this time you should see your name at top right rather than the log in button. The list includes options for a large number of collections. In this workbook we\u2019ll only be looking at the collections that are the most relevant for creating the maps you\u2019ll need during your course, but if you are interested in any of the others feel free to explore them. EDINA have worked to make all of the tools similar across each collection, so just have a go! Browsing maps on screen Each Digimap collection provides a Roam and a Download interface. The Roam interface allows you to view the data from that collection on a map on screen. Using Digimap OS Roam As an example click on Ordnance Survey on the menu at the top of the main screen Then select Roam under View, annotate & print a map on the right. Have a go at zooming in and out and exploring the map at different scales. Try searching for a location in the Search box at the top left. In this module we\u2019ll be making most use of the Download interface, but it\u2019s worth knowing what the Roam interface will do too, so have a quick go with a few of the tools on the left before continuing with the next exercise. If you want more information about using the Roam interface have a look at the Digimap Resource Centre which is linked from Resources on the main page. Downloading data from Digimap Data Download is the tool for downloading data for use in GIS or CAD software. The format that the data is delivered in will determine whether you will be able to open it directly in a software package or whether you will need to convert it. We\u2019ll be using data from Digimap in QGIS for various exercises in the rest of this module, so you need to know your way around this section. Instructions for converting, importing and viewing file types that need it will be given later in the workbook. As an example of the download interface we\u2019ll download some Ordnance Survey data. Start from the Digimap main page (you can get back to it by clicking on the icon at the top right of the map - hover over to see a tool tip) click on Ordnance Survey in the menu at the top of the page from the Ordnance Survey page choose Data Download Data Download takes you to a map that looks very similar to Digimap Roam, but with some important differences. Selecting an area On the left there is a menu panel with options for selecting an area, with a search box above it. Click in the Search box and type Otley , then press Enter or click on the magnifying glass to search When you get the results click on Otley (Leeds) to zoom in, then close the search results Under Draw click on the rectangle and use the mouse to draw a box around the area shown by an orange box in the image below, clicking to start and finish the box. It doesn\u2019t matter if the box you draw is a bit bigger, but try not to make it any smaller. Area view Note that the map you see on the screen only shows the area that you will be downloading data for, not the actual data that you\u2019ll be downloading. You\u2019ll select the data in the next section so don\u2019t worry what it looks like for now. Selecting data sets Now that you have selected an area you have to select the data that you need. Back in the panel on the left, under Select Data Products , drop down each of the headings, e.g. Backdrop Mapping, in turn by clicking on the arrow next to them. There are a lot of different data sets here and most of them won\u2019t mean anything to you. For now select the following data sets when you find them, by putting a tick in the box next to them. Backdrop mapping: VectorMap Local Raster Land and Height data: OS Terrain 5 Contours You can get more information about the data sets by clicking on the arrow next to them. This includes information on licences - which you will need to know later. The number on the right in brackets under Order Size shows how many tiles your selected area uses out of the maximum downloadable number. If you have chosen a slightly different area to me your number may be different but you should still be well within the limit. When you have selected the data you require click on Add to Basket (Don\u2019t worry, despite the Basket and Checkout you won\u2019t be charged. The University has already paid the subscription.) Your basket should appear with details of your order. Some datasets will give you an option to change the format. In this case click on Select Format next to the OS Terrain 5 Contours. The choices are Shape, GML3 or DWG . Choose Shape in this case. You may also need to select a theme. For the VectorMap Local Raster there is a choice of themes - pick Black and white for this exercise, though it is worth downloading the others to have a look at them too. Some items will have a Clip option. This means that the data will be sent to you clipped to the area outline that you requested. If you are short of disk space this is very useful as it restricts the amount of data you need to download, but otherwise it doesn\u2019t hurt to have extra data around the outside of your study area. I prefer to untick this box and download full map tiles. Give the order a name, e.g. OtleyOS (for Ordnance Survey). This will be part of the file name of the zip file that you download, so try to make it short but helpful! Click on Request Download Downloading your data. You\u2019ll receive an email confirming your order, then another with a download link. This can sometimes take a while to arrive, depending on how busy the service is. Make sure that you are still logged in to Digimap before you click on the download link. Once you have clicked on the link a browser window should open telling you that your order is ready to download. Click on Download You\u2019ll download a zip file. NOTE: Don\u2019t run or open the file directly from your browser, and make sure that you DON\u2019T save your zip file to a temp folder where you will probably be unable to unzip it. Warning Make sure that you remember where you have saved the zip file. Now open File Explorer (in Windows) and navigate to the location where you saved the zip file. Right-click on the compressed map data file that downloaded and choose to Extract files... - or 7-zip > Extract files... if you have 7-zip available. Select where you want to save the extracted files, and make a note of where you save them to You should end up with a folder for each dataset that you requested plus text files showing citations and contents. The folders will also have the order number as part of their name. Viewing your data In this case the files that you have downloaded are either tiff graphics files or shapefiles. Navigate to the data that you downloaded in the file explorer and find the folder called something like vml-raster_bwr_3612556 (your order number will be different). you\u2019ll also need to go into a folder with the OS grid letters - in this case for Otley it should be se Open one of the .tif files by double-clicking on it - the file should open in a graphics program, but that depends what you have set up on your computer. Don\u2019t worry if it doesn\u2019t! You should be able to see that this is basically a \u201cpicture\u201d of a map. Try opening one of the .shp files from the terrain-5_3612555 folder too. It\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to. Just cancel that and don\u2019t try finding software that will open it! Warning Both folders will contain files that have similar names to the .shp and .tif files, but different file extensions. These won\u2019t open in any programme but are essential for using the data in GIS programs such as QGIS, so make sure that you always keep these files together. Both of these formats will open in QGIS in the same way that you added data to your map in the Introduction to GIS . You don\u2019t need to keep the files that you have just downloaded. Copyright acknowledgements for Digimap data Copyright is important. Remember that most data providers ask you to sign up to conditions that include an obligation to add a copyright acknowledgement to your map. Check what that copyright statement is and add it. When you signed up to use the Digimap collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. The wording does change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check it for yourself. To find these copyright acknowledgements: go back to the main Digimap home page go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements under Popular Resources and click on it Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used - in this case the Ordnance Survey Collection You may need to download a pdf file rather than see it on a web page - do so and then open the pdf. then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text. For example, as of August 2020 when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your maps. \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Adding the copyright symbol to your text To add the copyright symbol - \u00a9 - to your text check that the Num lock is on on the keyboard hold down the Alt key on the keyboard then use the number pad to type 0169 release the Alt key Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when you registered. If you are not using U.K. Ordnance Survey data this is not the correct copyright acknowledgement to use. For example, if you are using data for Spain or the United States, or indeed UK data that you haven\u2019t downloaded from Digimap. You\u2019ll need to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for yourself. Advice on citing Digimap data , as opposed to the copyright acknowledgement is given in the Digimap Resource Centre. The GIS Lounge page on How to cite GIS materials gives some information about citing the software as well as the data. Have a look at that and follow the suggestions to cite non-Digimap data. Other Digimap collections In addition to Ordnance Survey Digimap you will also find that you\u2019ll make use of some of the other collections, in particular Geology Digimap and Aerial Digimap . The Roam and Download interfaces work in a very similar way to the Ordnance Survey collection so you should find that you already know how to use them. You\u2019ll be downloading BGS data from Digimap and adding it to your map of the Llanbedr area later in the course. You have access to all of these collections so feel free to have a look at what is available and make use of any of the data or maps in your work. Exploring other Digimap collections Go into the Historic Digimap Collection and use Historic Roam to look up either your house or the University using old maps. Try the 2 up view to see how you can compare old and new mapping of the same area. Digimap Collections online help Digimap help is available from each of the collection pages. Click on the links in the left-hand menu for more information about how to use the services and file formats. Alternatively use the Help links from within Roam or Download or use the videos that EDINA have uploaded to YouTube If you want more detailed information EDINA provide e-learning units which are linked from the main Digimap home page . Data from the web EDINA Digimap provides a wide range of useful data covering the UK, but you are also likely to need data from outwith the UK, or UK data that isn\u2019t provided by Digimap. It isn\u2019t possible to cover everything in this session, but I will show you one particular source which you should find useful. Natural Earth Data Natural Earth is a free, public domain dataset consisting of raster and vector data that will allow you to make maps at general scales. If you want a map of the World, or a general map of a particular country, this is a good starting point. Start by going to Natural Earth in your browser The front page gives an overview of the principles behind the data and an idea of the scales at which it is available. You can find more information under the Features tab, including the file formats and the coordinate system - both important for using the data within GIS. Natural Earth data Go to the Features page and make a note of the file types of both the raster and vector data provided by Natural Earth and of the coordinate system that the data comes in. To download data either Click the Get the Data green button on the front page or click on the Downloads tab at the top of the site Choose the scale that you want to download and the type of data that you want, e.g. cultural, physical or raster For this exercise download the following data: Medium scale data, 1:50m > Cultural > Admin 0 - Countries - click on the Download countries button to download a zip file. Make a note of where this file is saved to on your disk. Medium scale data, 1:50m > Raster > Natural Earth 1 - click the Download small size button under Natural Earth 1 with Shaded Relief and Water . Again, make a note of where the zip file is saved. Keep these data layers for later exercises. If you are working on a University computer you will need to make sure that the files are within your own disk space, either on your M: drive, or a USB drive. If you are working on the VWD make sure that you save the data to your network (M:/ drive). Have a look at the summary of the data on the Features page. If you wish try downloading other datasets. You can try adding them to a blank map in QGIS in the same way that you added data in the Introduction to GIS. Natural Earth data copyright Finding and acknowledging the copyright of data is very important. Return to the Natural Earth front page Look at the text in the box next to the Get the Data button. One of the links there is to the Terms of Use page. Click on that now. Acknowledging Natural Earth data Read the Terms of Use of Natural Earth data How should you acknowledge the Natural Earth data if you use it in one of your maps? The terms of use do say that \u201cCrediting the authors is unnecessary\u201d, however, it is still a good idea to add the data acknowledgement to your map to avoid any possibility of plagiarism. You can choose whether to use the short or long text listed on the page. Adding the url of the data can also be a very good idea. Finding other data online These are just a few examples of finding useful data for GIS. Through out the rest of the workbook you\u2019ll be downloading your own data from Digimap. If you need data from elsewhere I\u2019ll either give full instructions or provide the data for you, but tell you where I got it from. If you are looking for data for a particular project it is well worth searching online using your favourite search engine (e.g. Google). Put the words \u201cgis\u201d and \u201cdata\u201d into your searches and it should help you to find relevant data. I have put together a short list of possible data sources which you are welcome to use to find data and maps.","title":"Finding spatial data"},{"location":"finding_data/#finding-spatial-data-to-use-in-gis","text":"The background to finding data will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

The lecture segment should help you to understand why you are doing these exercises. If you still aren\u2019t sure, please ask Clare . Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to Explain what a geopackage consists of and why it is used to store GIS data understand how you can collect your own spatial data for use in GIS explain how to symbolise data on a map so that it displays clearly and informatively to your audience Introduction The previous chapter should have given you some idea of the variety of data that is available for you to use, but there is nothing to replace going out and collecting your own data and it is very likely that you will be using GPS units for fieldwork at some point. If you are new to GPS and would like to find out more about the background and technology there is a beginners guide at: Garmin Collecting data with a GPS unit Unfortunately this year (2020) it isn\u2019t possible for us to go out onto campus as a group and collect waypoints with a GPS unit so I will provide the data for you. If you have access to a GPS unit you could go outside on your own and collect waypoints . Note that this exercise doesn\u2019t make use of tracks or routes. You should then download a .gpx file from your GPS and follow the instructions in the rest of this chapter. Data to download Download the file GPS_data_ChanCourt_2020.zip from the Week 8 folder in Minerva Save the file to your disk and unzip it The zip file should contain the following items a folder called mastermap several files which make up a single shapefile called LocationBNG.shp - make sure that you keep all of these files together Waypoints_26-FEB-14.gpx - waypoints which I collected back in 2014 and luckily still have. This is the file downloaded from gps unit. Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf - a map showing the location and type of all of the waypoints that I collected. Starting a new project in QGIS You can just open QGIS and start adding data, but it will help you later if you take more care at this stage. Open QGIS Go to Project > Save and navigate to the folder in which you would like to save your project. This could be a folder called gis with a subfolder called ChancellorsCourt - note that there should not be any spaces in the folder name. Give your project a name, e.g. ChanCourt - short and no spaces. Save Having done that you should have a file in your folder called ChanCourt.qgz . Go to Project > Properties in the menu in QGIS and click on the General heading on the left The Project file should already be filled in Set Project home to the folder in which you saved the qgz file Set the Project title to something like Chancellors Court, University of Leeds - basically a description of what your map is going to show. Check that Save paths is set to relative Click OK Save paths is probably the most important project setting as it can save you from having data go missing if you move your project to another computer. By setting this to relative , as long as you move the whole folder, your data and your map will stay linked. Using the Browser to find information about a layer Now that you have the Project home set it is possible to use that heading in the Browser to find everything associated with this project (assuming all of your files are in that folder). Go to the Browser (if it isn\u2019t already open go to View > Panels and put a tick next to Browser ). Click on the little arrow next to Project Home to see the contents of the folder. You should see all of the files that you unzipped earlier. One of the benefits of the browser is being able to have a look at the details of your data before you add it to a map. If you are in version 3.16 or above of QGIS click on the little arrow next to Waypoints_26-FEB-14.gpx You should see that the file includes several layers . For this exercise the only one we want is waypoints Right-click on the waypoints layer and go to Layer Properties If you are in version 3.10 of QGIS you won\u2019t be able to see the layers within the gpx file, but you can still get the right data. Right-click on the Waypoints_26-FEB-14.gpx layer and go to Layer Properties In both versions Use the three tabs at the top of the layer properties - Metadata 1 , Preview and Attributes - to have a look at your file. The Metadata tab tells you quite a lot, but the Preview tab can confirm that your data looks correct, and the Attributes tab will let you see the table of data that you have. Make a note of the CRS One particularly important piece of information is the CRS, or Coordinate Reference System. You\u2019ll need to know this later. Make a note of the text next to the CRS subheading in the Metadata then close the Layer Properties. Adding a gpx layer to a map This is slightly different in the older and newer versions of QGIS. In version 3.16: Drag and drop the waypoints layer from the Browser to the Layers panel. In version 3.10: Double-click on `Waypoints_26-FEB-14.gpx\u2019 in the Browser In the Select Vector Layers to Add dialog select waypoints Click on OK In both versions You should now have a map showing small circles for each of the waypoints which looks something like the image below. (Your colours may be different.) Exporting gpx layer to a geopackage As the layer is stored at the moment, this is not a proper GIS layer. If you are going to use these points for further analysis or measurements you need to export them to a GIS format, such as a layer in a Geopackage . Geopackage format A geopackage is a form of database designed to store spatial data. It has been relatively recently developed but it\u2019s use as a GIS format has spread very quickly. QGIS encourages the use of geopackages and it is increasingly possible to use them in other GIS software. You will store vector data in a geopackage as multiple layers. If you want more information about the format there is a lot on the GeoPackage website . To export the waypoints to a geopackage layer: In the Layers panel right-click on the waypoints layer Export > Save Features As... Fill in the panel that opens as follows: Format = GeoPackage Click on the ... button at the end of the File name box, navigate to the folder in which you want to store your geopackage - preferably the same folder as your .qgz file, then give your geopackage a name, e.g. University.gpkg . The location tends to be a good idea here. Save In the Layer name box give your layer a name such as Waypoints - it needs to be a name that will tell you what data this layer contains. Check that the CRS field is the same as the CRS you made a note of earlier - in this case that should be EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 Check the bottom of the form to make sure that Add saved file to map is ticked. Click OK to create the geopackage and add the new layer to your map. Your map won\u2019t look much different, though the dots may have changed colour. The new GeoPackage should have appeared in the Browser in the folder you saved it to. Have a look at that now and drop down the arrow next to the .gpkg file to check that the Waypoints layer is there. Components of a GeoPackage If you have a look at the same .gpkg file in your file explorer outside of QGIS you\u2019ll probably see three files with the same name but slightly different extensions - .gpkg , .gpkg-shm and .gpkg-wal . The last two are temporary files which appear when the geopackage is open in QGIS. The geopackage itself is a single file and without appropriate software, such as QGIS, you can\u2019t open it and see the contents. To keep the Layers panel tidy right click on the original waypoints layer and Remove layer... Installing QGIS plugin to display a background map At the moment you have your waypoints on a map, but can\u2019t check where they are located because the background is just plain white. One of the strengths of QGIS is that it has a wide variety of plugins that you can install to carry out extra tasks. One of these plugins allows you to add maps from the web as background maps so we\u2019ll install that now. In the menu go to Plugins > Manage And Install Plugins... When it opens click on the Installed heading on the left to see the plugins that are already installed. If you click on a plugin you\u2019ll be able to see a bit about it in the panel on the right. To install a new plugin: Click on Not installed on the left Type QuickMapServices into the search box at the top From the list that appears click on QuickMapServices and have a look at the description This plugin will do what you want it to do so click on Install Plugin Once it has installed you should get a message at the top telling you it has been successful and QuickMap Services should now be in the list of Installed plugins. You can Close the plugin manager now. Once the plugin is installed you will have new menu items and toolbar buttons available to you. On the menu go to Web > QuickMapServices . You should have a very long list of choices available. Go to OSM > OSM Standard . OSM stands for OpenStreetMap which is a crowd-sourced map of the World. It can be very useful for quick maps, but isn\u2019t always completely reliable and some areas don\u2019t have much data. Now that you\u2019ve added the OSM Standard basemap you should be able to see the details of Chancellors Court at the University with your waypoints shown on top. If you can\u2019t see your waypoints check that they are above the basemap in the Layers pane. Zoom to 1:500 to see the buildings around Chancellors Court too. If your points are not appearing over Chancellors Court then there may have been something wrong with the CRS when you imported them. Try importing them again and be careful with the settings. Other QuickMapServices basemaps Have a look at some of the other basemaps from QuickMapServices. Not all will cover this area, and some need a licence key, but there are plenty of choices. You will need to switch off other basemaps in the Layers when you add new ones so that you can see them. For example, try Bing Map Bing Satellite OSM Cycle map OSM monochrome Finish with the OSM monochrome basemap on your map with all of the other basemap layers removed. The monochrome (black and white) background map will make your data easier to see. Don\u2019t forget to Save your map regularly. Adding extra data to feature classes The layer that you have saved to a Geopackage is known in GIS terms as a feature class . This contains your features and data for each one which are called attributes . In the Layers panel right-click on your waypoints layer and select Open Attribute Table . The attribute table is the GIS equivalent of a spreadsheet and contains features and their attributes. Amongst many other attributes there should be one for name which should include the label or name of each waypoint as stored by the GPS unit. In this case the name field holds a number which matches the numbers of the points on the Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf file which you downloaded from Minerva. Open the file Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf from the downloaded data and have a look at the information there Labels on the map show the name field followed by a description of the type of feature, e.g. Rock, Sign post, Planter. Somehow we need to get that extra information in to the attribute table and unfortunately that has to be done manually! Have another look at the waypoints attribute table. There is a field there called desc for description. This seems to be a sensible field in which to put the new information. To start adding attributes to a table you need to start editing the feature class. On the attribute table window click on the Toggle Editing Mode button at top left (see the annotated picture of the attribute table above, and remember that tool tips are visible if you hover over buttons). If you\u2019re not sure whether a layer is editable have a look at the Layers panel - any layer toggled for editing will have a little pencil symbol on the left. Click in the space under desc for the point with the name 001 - the word NULL should be selected Look at the pdf map and find point 001 (it\u2019s top left of Chancellors Court) - what is the description of it? If you have trouble finding it try selecting the feature in the attribute table by clicking on the number in the grey space on the left. The point will then be highlighted on your map in QGIS The description for point 001 should be Sign post so type that in to the attribute table. Click on the Save edits button on the attribute table toolbar to write your edits to the feature class in the geopackage. Continue doing this for some more of the points. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find some of them on the map - just leave those blank (NULL). Try to do a minimum of about 20 of the points. There are rather a lot there and you don\u2019t need to do all of them on this occasion! Once you\u2019ve input the descriptions (and saved your edits) click on the Toggle Editing Mode button again to stop editing then close the attribute table by clicking on the cross in the top right. Styling the point layer Now that you have the description in your attribute table you can style your point layer, initially as a single symbol but then with different symbols for different types of feature. Styling a layer as a single symbol The default styling is for single symbols. Select the waypoints layer in the Layers panel and click on the Open the Layer Styling panel button - at the top of the Layers panel on the left or from the menu go to View > Panels' and put a tick next to Layer Styling`. This should open on the right of the map window and gives you choices for the way your layer looks. In this view you can click on any of the symbols in the gallery and the symbols on your map will change to match them. Try this now by picking any symbol from the gallery. The section at the top allows you to change the size, opacity and colour of the symbols. Again, try changing the choices there and see what they do. You get more choices if you click on the Simple marker symbol layer. Styling a layer as categories So far you have a single coloured symbol representing every point. Your map would be much more informative if each type of feature had it\u2019s own symbol. At the top of the Layer Styling panel click on the dropdown that says Single symbol and change it to Categorized Now drop down the list next to Value and select the field that you want to categorize your symbols on - in this case desc Lower down the panel click on the button that says Classify Your descriptions should appear as a list and the symbols on your map should change to a variety of random colours. Note that the attributes that you left as NULL in the attribute table have all been styled as a symbol listed as all other... . It would be good to get rid of that as it isn\u2019t adding any useful information to the map. In the Layer Styling panel untick the box on the left of the all other... category. Alternatively you can click on this and then on the Delete button at the bottom of the panel to get rid of the symbol completely. The NULL symbols should all disappear from the map. Note that the Layers panel on the left now acts as a key to your waypoints layer. Changing to svg markers You can change the symbols by double-clicking on each symbol in turn and selecting different ones from the Gallery. At the moment all of your symbols are Simple markers . It is easy to change them to SVG markers and have a wider range of symbols to choose from. Double click on the first symbol in your list in the Layer Styling panel (in my example it is Bike shelter ) In the box at the top click where it says Simple marker Below that change the Symbol layer type to SVG marker SVG stands for Scaleable Vector Graphics and is basically what it says. In the context of QGIS it gives you a much greater range of pictorial symbols with which to style your map. Have a look at the SVG Image gallery at the bottom of the panel and select an appropriate symbol. You can use the settings above the change the size, colour, rotation etc. The symbols should appear on your map automatically, but if they don\u2019t click on Apply When you\u2019ve finished click on the back arrow at the top of the panel to get back to the list. Choose symbols for your points Continue in the same way to select appropriate symbols for the rest of the categories of point. Once you\u2019ve finished setting the symbols for the waypoints, save your map and close it. Changing the coordinate system (CRS) of data The GPS data that you have collected is in the WGS 84 geographic coordinate system. Remember that you checked this earlier . QGIS sets the project CRS to that of the first layer that you add to the map. So in this case the map CRS is also WGS 84. Often you will need to use data in a local projected coordinate system. The obvious example is if you are using Ordnance Survey maps from Digimap in the same project. This is the example we will use now, but the same situation can arise if you are, for example, creating a map of Spain or Eire 2 . We\u2019ll set up a map project in British National Grid and add the gps data to that. Open QGIS from the start menu, but don\u2019t open a map. Use the browser panel to drag the LocationBNG.shp shapefile that you will have downloaded from Minerva to the Layers panel. It should appear in your map area. Remember that the first layer that you add to a map automatically sets the coordinate system. You may get a window like the one below asking about Transforms, just click OK on this for now. This is to do with ways of \u201ctransforming\u201d data from one CRS to another. You should find that you have a map with two polygons in a random colour. If you look at the bottom right of the map window you should be able to see the text EPSG:27700 . This is the code for British National Grid and confirms that your map is in the correct CRS. Save your map to the same folder as the previous map. Call it something like UniversityBNG.qgz - BNG = British National Grid. Add the OSM monochrome base map to your map again. You already have the plugin installed so don\u2019t need to do that again. Style the LocationBNG polygon layer so that it has an outline but no fill. You should be able to see the base map through it. Styling a polygon layer is very similar to styling points so you should be able to use the previous instructions again. Now it should be possible to see that both polygons cover parts of the University, but the one that is relevant for this map is the one to the south which covers Chancellors Court. Zoom in to the polygon to the south. Now add the Waypoints layer from your geopackage (not from the original gpx file) to the Layers panel from the Browser. They should appear in the correct place, even though they have a CRS of WGS 84 and the map is in British National Grid. You can check this in the layer properties if you want to. QGIS is projecting the layer \u201con the fly\u201d using a transformation . This is very convenient, and if you are just going to look at the map that is fine. But if you need to do any analysis or measure anything then you really need to get this layer projected in to British National Grid as well. To project the layer permanently Right click on the Waypoints layer in the Layers panel or in the Browser Export > Save features as... Fill in the Save Vector Layer as... dialog as follows The Format should be GeoPackage Click on the three dots button next to File name and browse to your existing Geopackage. Give the output a Layer name which will remind you what it contains, e.g. WaypointsBNG Drop down the CRS and select Project CRS: EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid . Finish by clicking OK Your map probably won\u2019t look much different but the new layer should have been added to the Layers panel. If it hasn\u2019t drag it over from the Browser. Check the new CRS by right-clicking on the new layer and going to Properties Look at the Information tab. The CRS heading should say EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid - Projected . If it doesn\u2019t you may have to try again and check everything carefully as you go along. Remove the original waypoints layer from your Layers panel and Save your map. Now you have a map in British National Grid which shows your waypoints and which, because all layers match the map CRS, can be used for analysis. Make sure you have both of your maps of Chancellors Court open in QGIS If you compare your two maps you should be able to see that the different CRS gives a very different idea of the \u201cshape\u201d of Chancellors Court. This is because the projected CRS, British National Grid, is designed to be best to display maps of Britain on a cartesian grid whereas the geographic CRS, WGS 84, is designed to display maps of the whole world in latitude and longitude. This means that the mathematics behind each CRS is rather different. Copying styles If you want to style the point symbols on your BNG map so that they are the same as the WGS 84 map try the following short cut: In the WGS 84 map right-click on the waypoints layer and select Styles > Copy Style > All style categories In the British National Grid map right-click on the waypoints layer and select Styles > Paste style > All style categories Your styles should be copied across and your map is ready to go! The final map Set the symbols on your map so that you are happy with them and zoom out so that a bit more of the University is visible. You should export your map from QGIS as an image and upload it to your GIS Portfolio. If you upload it within a week of the class I will give you feedback on your work. When you are happy with your map go to Project > Import / Export > Export Map to Image In the Save Map as Image dialog set the extent by clicking on the Map Canvas Extent button Click on Save In a later chapter you\u2019ll find out how to create a full map layout with a key, scale bar, measured grid etc and print or export that properly, but for now this is fine. Keep this project for the next chapter In the next chapter you will be creating data in QGIS by digitising. We will use the area of Chancellors Court again, so keep this project for that. Further information and suggested reading Many of the books in the reading list 3 have a general introduction to GIS which explain what it is and how it is used. Suggestions include the following: Chapter 2, Spatial data in Heywood, I., Cornelius, S. and Carver, S. (2011), pp.65-67 cover GPS. Chapter 4, Georeferencing in Longley, P.A. et al. (2015), pp. 77-98 covers latitude and longitude (from p.86),projections and coordinate systems (from p.88) and gps (from p.94). If you want to find out more about coordinate systems and projections in general then the definitive guide is the USGS Professional Paper 1395 by John P. Snyder (1987) called Map Projections: A working manual . This is downloadable as a pdf. The QGIS Documentation has a chapter on Working with GPS data which covers much more than we have been able to cover here. Working with GPS data for v. 3.10 of QGIS Working with GPS data for v. 3.16 of QGIS Metadata can be described as \u201cdata about data\u201d. A commonly quoted example is a library catalogue, which holds data about books. \u21a9 If you want to find out more about coordinate systems and projections have a look at Heywood (2011) pp. 44-51 for a general introduction. \u21a9 The reading list is available in Minerva and from the library (search for the number of this module). \u21a9","title":"Creating point data with GPS"},{"location":"gps/#creating-point-data-with-gps","text":"The background to creating point data with gps will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

The Metadata tab tells you quite a lot, but the Preview tab can confirm that your data looks correct, and the Attributes tab will let you see the table of data that you have. Make a note of the CRS One particularly important piece of information is the CRS, or Coordinate Reference System. You\u2019ll need to know this later.

If you are going to use these points for further analysis or measurements you need to export them to a GIS format, such as a layer in a Geopackage . Geopackage format A geopackage is a form of database designed to store spatial data. It has been relatively recently developed but it\u2019s use as a GIS format has spread very quickly. QGIS encourages the use of geopackages and it is increasingly possible to use them in other GIS software. You will store vector data in a geopackage as multiple layers. If you want more information about the format there is a lot on the GeoPackage website . To export the waypoints to a geopackage layer: In the Layers panel right-click on the waypoints layer Export > Save Features As... Fill in the panel that opens as follows: Format = GeoPackage Click on the ... button at the end of the File name box, navigate to the folder in which you want to store your geopackage - preferably the same folder as your .qgz file, then give your geopackage a name, e.g. University.gpkg . The location tends to be a good idea here. Save In the Layer name box give your layer a name such as Waypoints - it needs to be a name that will tell you what data this layer contains. Check that the CRS field is the same as the CRS you made a note of earlier - in this case that should be EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 Check the bottom of the form to make sure that Add saved file to map is ticked. Click OK to create the geopackage and add the new layer to your map. Your map won\u2019t look much different, though the dots may have changed colour. The new GeoPackage should have appeared in the Browser in the folder you saved it to. Have a look at that now and drop down the arrow next to the .gpkg file to check that the Waypoints layer is there. Components of a GeoPackage If you have a look at the same .gpkg file in your file explorer outside of QGIS you\u2019ll probably see three files with the same name but slightly different extensions - .gpkg , .gpkg-shm and .gpkg-wal . The last two are temporary files which appear when the geopackage is open in QGIS. The geopackage itself is a single file and without appropriate software, such as QGIS, you can\u2019t open it and see the contents.

One of the strengths of QGIS is that it has a wide variety of plugins that you can install to carry out extra tasks. One of these plugins allows you to add maps from the web as background maps so we\u2019ll install that now. In the menu go to Plugins > Manage And Install Plugins... When it opens click on the Installed heading on the left to see the plugins that are already installed. If you click on a plugin you\u2019ll be able to see a bit about it in the panel on the right. To install a new plugin: Click on Not installed on the left Type QuickMapServices into the search box at the top From the list that appears click on QuickMapServices and have a look at the description This plugin will do what you want it to do so click on Install Plugin Once it has installed you should get a message at the top telling you it has been successful and QuickMap Services should now be in the list of Installed plugins. You can Close the plugin manager now. Once the plugin is installed you will have new menu items and toolbar buttons available to you. On the menu go to Web > QuickMapServices . You should have a very long list of choices available. Go to OSM > OSM Standard . OSM stands for OpenStreetMap which is a crowd-sourced map of the World. It can be very useful for quick maps, but isn\u2019t always completely reliable and some areas don\u2019t have much data. Now that you\u2019ve added the OSM Standard basemap you should be able to see the details of Chancellors Court at the University with your waypoints shown on top. If you can\u2019t see your waypoints check that they are above the basemap in the Layers pane. Zoom to 1:500 to see the buildings around Chancellors Court too. If your points are not appearing over Chancellors Court then there may have been something wrong with the CRS when you imported them. Try importing them again and be careful with the settings. Other QuickMapServices basemaps Have a look at some of the other basemaps from QuickMapServices. Not all will cover this area, and some need a licence key, but there are plenty of choices. You will need to switch off other basemaps in the Layers when you add new ones so that you can see them. For example, try Bing Map Bing Satellite OSM Cycle map OSM monochrome Finish with the OSM monochrome basemap on your map with all of the other basemap layers removed.

This contains your features and data for each one which are called attributes . In the Layers panel right-click on your waypoints layer and select Open Attribute Table . The attribute table is the GIS equivalent of a spreadsheet and contains features and their attributes. Amongst many other attributes there should be one for name which should include the label or name of each waypoint as stored by the GPS unit. In this case the name field holds a number which matches the numbers of the points on the Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf file which you downloaded from Minerva. Open the file Waypoints_type_26-FEB-14_map.pdf from the downloaded data and have a look at the information there Labels on the map show the name field followed by a description of the type of feature, e.g. Rock, Sign post, Planter. Somehow we need to get that extra information in to the attribute table and unfortunately that has to be done manually! Have another look at the waypoints attribute table. There is a field there called desc for description. This seems to be a sensible field in which to put the new information. To start adding attributes to a table you need to start editing the feature class. On the attribute table window click on the Toggle Editing Mode button at top left (see the annotated picture of the attribute table above, and remember that tool tips are visible if you hover over buttons). If you\u2019re not sure whether a layer is editable have a look at the Layers panel - any layer toggled for editing will have a little pencil symbol on the left. Click in the space under desc for the point with the name 001 - the word NULL should be selected Look at the pdf map and find point 001 (it\u2019s top left of Chancellors Court) - what is the description of it? If you have trouble finding it try selecting the feature in the attribute table by clicking on the number in the grey space on the left. The point will then be highlighted on your map in QGIS The description for point 001 should be Sign post so type that in to the attribute table. Click on the Save edits button on the attribute table toolbar to write your edits to the feature class in the geopackage. Continue doing this for some more of the points. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find some of them on the map - just leave those blank (NULL). Try to do a minimum of about 20 of the points. There are rather a lot there and you don\u2019t need to do all of them on this occasion!

Remember that you checked this earlier . QGIS sets the project CRS to that of the first layer that you add to the map. So in this case the map CRS is also WGS 84. Often you will need to use data in a local projected coordinate system. The obvious example is if you are using Ordnance Survey maps from Digimap in the same project. This is the example we will use now, but the same situation can arise if you are, for example, creating a map of Spain or Eire 2 . We\u2019ll set up a map project in British National Grid and add the gps data to that. Open QGIS from the start menu, but don\u2019t open a map. Use the browser panel to drag the LocationBNG.shp shapefile that you will have downloaded from Minerva to the Layers panel. It should appear in your map area. Remember that the first layer that you add to a map automatically sets the coordinate system. You may get a window like the one below asking about Transforms, just click OK on this for now. This is to do with ways of \u201ctransforming\u201d data from one CRS to another. You should find that you have a map with two polygons in a random colour. If you look at the bottom right of the map window you should be able to see the text EPSG:27700 . This is the code for British National Grid and confirms that your map is in the correct CRS. Save your map to the same folder as the previous map. Call it something like UniversityBNG.qgz - BNG = British National Grid. Add the OSM monochrome base map to your map again. You already have the plugin installed so don\u2019t need to do that again. Style the LocationBNG polygon layer so that it has an outline but no fill. You should be able to see the base map through it. Styling a polygon layer is very similar to styling points so you should be able to use the previous instructions again. Now it should be possible to see that both polygons cover parts of the University, but the one that is relevant for this map is the one to the south which covers Chancellors Court. Zoom in to the polygon to the south. Now add the Waypoints layer from your geopackage (not from the original gpx file) to the Layers panel from the Browser. They should appear in the correct place, even though they have a CRS of WGS 84 and the map is in British National Grid. You can check this in the layer properties if you want to. QGIS is projecting the layer \u201con the fly\u201d using a transformation . This is very convenient, and if you are just going to look at the map that is fine. But if you need to do any analysis or measure anything then you really need to get this layer projected in to British National Grid as well. To project the layer permanently Right click on the Waypoints layer in the Layers panel or in the Browser Export > Save features as... Fill in the Save Vector Layer as... dialog as follows The Format should be GeoPackage Click on the three dots button next to File name and browse to your existing Geopackage. Give the output a Layer name which will remind you what it contains, e.g. WaypointsBNG Drop down the CRS and select Project CRS: EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid . Finish by clicking OK Your map probably won\u2019t look much different but the new layer should have been added to the Layers panel. If it hasn\u2019t drag it over from the Browser. Check the new CRS by right-clicking on the new layer and going to Properties Look at the Information tab. The CRS heading should say EPSG:27700 - OSGB 1936 / British National Grid - Projected . If it doesn\u2019t you may have to try again and check everything carefully as you go along. Remove the original waypoints layer from your Layers panel and Save your map. Now you have a map in British National Grid which shows your waypoints and which, because all layers match the map CRS, can be used for analysis. Make sure you have both of your maps of Chancellors Court open in QGIS If you compare your two maps you should be able to see that the different CRS gives a very different idea of the \u201cshape\u201d of Chancellors Court. This is because the projected CRS, British National Grid, is designed to be best to display maps of Britain on a cartesian grid whereas the geographic CRS, WGS 84, is designed to display maps of the whole world in latitude and longitude. This means that the mathematics behind each CRS is rather different.","title":"Changing the coordinate system (CRS) of data"},{"location":"gps/#copying-styles","text":"If you want to style the point symbols on your BNG map so that they are the same as the WGS 84 map try the following short cut: In the WGS 84 map right-click on the waypoints layer and select Styles > Copy Style > All style categories In the British National Grid map right-click on the waypoints layer and select Styles > Paste style > All style categories Your styles should be copied across and your map is ready to go!","title":"Copying styles"},{"location":"gps/#the-final-map","text":"Set the symbols on your map so that you are happy with them and zoom out so that a bit more of the University is visible.

Creating xyz files Xyz files can be either comma separated value text files (often with an extension of .csv ) or Excel or OpenOffice/LibreOffice spreadsheets. They contain point data which includes coordinates for a geographic location either in two dimensions (x and y) or three (x,y and z). Open the LlanbedrGravity.xls in a spreadsheet program now and have a look at the data it contains. QGIS can only import xyz data from .csv files. You can either save the data as csv in Excel or OpenOffice or create it directly in a text editor such as Notepad++ (not Word!). Use Excel, OpenOffice or LibreOffice to convert the Excel file to csv - File > Save As... set the format to CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv) (not to any of the other versions of csv) Warning Note that column headings need to be short and contain no spaces or non-standard characters - so text and numbers only. Also note that the column heading mustn\u2019t start with a number. In particular note the Eastings and Northings columns - these are in effect the x and y columns. These are in British National Grid 1 m coordinates (The grid numbers such as SH or SJ have been replaced with numbers - 22 and 23). Other numerical columns can be used for the z values, or the data. In this case we\u2019ll be using the CorrBA (Corrected Bouguer Anomaly in mGal) as the z values. Import points from xyz file to QGIS Start by opening your map of Llanbedr in North Wales in QGIS. You should have a view of the 1:25 000 raster map from Ordnance Survey. If not, turn layers on and off as required, and add the 1:25 000 raster map from the Browser if necessary. If you add the xyz file to your map directly it won\u2019t appear. QGIS will view it as a table without spatial information. You need to tell QGIS which fields contain the x and y data before it can display it.

You should finish this chapter with a project containing the points imported from the original spreadsheet with the 1:25 000 raster background from Ordnance Survey providing a background map. In the next chapter we\u2019ll look at how we can analyse the points and display the data in different ways. Make sure you have this project saved and move on to the next chapter. I\u2019ve used a geopackage here, but it could be exported to any GIS format such as a shapefile instead. \u21a9","title":"Exporting a layer to a geopackage"},{"location":"introduction/","text":"Introduction to GIS with QGIS The background to GIS and an explanation of what it is will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva. The lecture segment should help you to understand why you are doing these exercises. If you still aren\u2019t sure, please ask Clare . Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate how to open a map project in QGIS select appropriate tools to navigate in a map document use layers to organise and display information on a map Introduction to the exercises The exercises in this workbook will build on each other so that by the end of this part of the module you will have used data from a variety of sources to create a map layout covering an area of North Wales near the village of Llanbedr. You will be able to include maps showing the gravity anomaly for the area and the geology. You will also include some interpretation of your maps. In this first section I have provided the data for you but as the exercises progress you will find out more about how to find your own data. Obtaining the data for this chapter You can download the data for this chapter from Minerva. Go to this module in Minerva, then to Learning Resources > GIS information > Week 7 Download NorthWalesDataQ.zip from this folder by right-clicking and saving to your local disk. Create a folder called gis in your file system. You\u2019ll need a total of about 170 MB of free space to complete the following exercises . Move the downloaded data into your gis folder Unzip the file in this location In My Computer right-click on the zip file If you have 7-zip go to 7-zip > Extract Here 1 If you don\u2019t have 7-zip, right-click Extract files... and select the location to save the files, then OK 2 Warning Never try to use the contents of a zipped file in QGIS without extracting it first - it won\u2019t work. If you are looking for a file in QGIS and can\u2019t find it, always check via My Computer that the file isn\u2019t inside a zip or 7zip archive. The contents of the zip file should look something like the following image when they are unzipped, with two further folders, a OSM.gpkg file and a NorthWales.qgz file. Opening the map project in QGIS The simplest way is to double-click on the NorthWales.qgz file in File Explorer . Alternatively first open QGIS by searching for it in the Start Menu box Then Project > Open navigate to where you put the project files and select NorthWales.qgz click Open The image below shows how the project will look in QGIS when you first open it. Note that yours may look different to mine as buttons and toolbars can vary in location. If you are using a version higher than 3.10.11 you may also get a notice at the top warning you about that. Just ignore it or close it, this won\u2019t be a problem for you. Navigation in QGIS Once you have data on a map in QGIS there are various tools which will allow you to zoom in and out and move around the map view. Zoom to Layer A lot of the work that you do in GIS will be layer-based. Each file that you add is a layer and will appear in the Layers panel on the left. Zoom to Layer is an extremely useful command to know and you\u2019ll probably find yourself using it a lot. Right-click on the Places layer (sub-heading) in the Layers panel Select Zoom to Layer Your map should zoom out so that you can see a bigger area of the Welsh coast. You\u2019re zoomed well out so this particular map looks a bit messy and may take a bit of time to load, but once it does you should be able to see Harlech and Dolgellau. The Map Navigation Toolbar Tools for zooming in and out and for moving around the map are available on the Map Navigation Toolbar . If the toolbar isn\u2019t already visible in QGIS go to View > Toolbars and tick the box next to Map Navigation Toolbar Trying out the navigation Try out the following tools in turn on your map so that you are aware of what they do. Pan - use the hand cursor to \u201cgrab\u201d the map and move it around Zoom in - click on the button, then on the map. You can also use the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out of your map. Zoom out - click on the button, then on the map. You can also use the middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out of your map. Full extent to see the whole map (again be patient while it loads) - then use Zoom to Layer to get back to the extent of the Places layer. Working with map layers in QGIS Layers are an essential part of any GIS. Each layer is a reference to a particular data source. In this project the layers so far include: Places Line features Polygon features Tidal water The Layers panel on the left hand side of the map window shows the layers that are in your map and how their features look and allows you to control their visibility. Viewing contents of layers If you have added vector data, which all of the layers so far are, you\u2019ll also be able to refer to the layers panel as a key to your symbols. This is particularly useful if a layer has multiple symbols. Click on the little arrow next to the Polygon features layer - assuming it started \u201cclosed\u201d, you should now be able to see lots of different symbols and an explanation of what they show. Click on the little arrow again to fold the list away and repeat this for the Places and Line features layers. Making layers visible and invisible There will be times when you don\u2019t want all of the layers to be visible on your map, but you won\u2019t necessarily want to actually remove them completely. It is simple to make layers visible and invisible. Click in the little box next to one of the layers - the tick will disappear and so will that layer in your map To make the layer visible click in the little box again. You\u2019ll notice in layers with multiple symbols that you can turn each of those off individually too. For example, Fold down the Places layer in the contents then untick next to Town The names for Harlech and Dolgellau should disappear, but if you zoom in you will still be able to see the other place names. Make sure you tick back in the Town box. Locating features The layers in your map at the moment are vector feature classes and are searchable (you\u2019ll find out more about the data types raster and vector later). Click in the Type to locate box at the lower left, or use Ctrl+K on the keyboard Have a look at the list of options that pops up - it looks a bit confusing to start with but is simple to use. Type the following in the box - af Harlech . The af shows that you want to search for Features in all layers As you type a list of options will appear - double-click on one of the options for Harlech Castle (it doesn\u2019t matter which) This can be a useful way of finding things on your map if you are using vector layers. Adding layers to QGIS with the Browser Now have a look at the Browser panel If you can\u2019t see the Browser which shows you where files are on your file system, go to: View > Panels and tick in the box next to Browser Using the Browser you should be able to navigate to the folder in which you saved your downloads. If you have saved your data in the same folder as the map you should be able to find everything under the Project Home heading, otherwise you\u2019ll have to browse through your file system. Browse to your downloaded files and look for a folder called gb-overview have a look in the folder and find a file called GBOverview.tif drag and drop that file to the Layers panel Right-click on the GBOverview layer in the Layers panel and Zoom to layer You should now be able to see a map of Great Britain in the main panel. This is probably the easiest way to add data to your maps. Adding raster data to a map with the Data Source Manager As with so many tasks in GIS there is more than one way to add data to QGIS. On the menu bar go to Layer > Data Source Manager Click on Raster on the left then click on the button with three dots next to the Source box Navigate to the raster-25k folder and select raster-25k_3706482.tif Click on Open Then click on Add , and then on Close The new layer will be added to your Layers panel, but you probably won\u2019t be able to see it on your map as it only covers a small area. Right-click on the raster-25k layer in the Layers panel and Zoom to Layer to be able to see the new map. It won\u2019t look great at this zoom level, but you can use the Zoom in button, or the middle mouse button, to see it more clearly. These two new layers are raster data types. Again, you\u2019ll find out more about these later. Adding vector data to a map The vector files on this map are all stored in a Geopackage called OSM.gpkg . This is a form of database which stores and retrieves spatial data efficiently. If you look at this in File Explorer you\u2019ll note that it looks like a single file. If you look at it in the Browser in QGIS you\u2019ll see there is a little arrow next to it - the advantage of using the browser is that it is specifically designed to work with spatial data. Drop down the little arrow next to OSM.gpkg You should be able to see the layers that are stored in the geopackage - as in the image above Select the multilinestrings layer in the Browser and drag and drop it into the Layers panel You may need to Zoom to layer to see what you have just added. It should be a few lines in a random colour. You can also add vector layers via the Data Source Manager Go to Layer > Data Source Manager Click on Vector on the left then click on the button with three dots next to the Source box Navigate to the OSM.gpkg file and select it Click on Open (If you\u2019re using a newer version of QGIS you\u2019ll also need to click on Add ) You\u2019ll get a choice of vector layers to add - select the points layer Then click on OK , and then on Close The new layer will be added to your Layers panel and you should see a lot of randomly coloured point symbols on your map. Removing layers Your map is looking rather a mess now, so let\u2019s clear it up a bit. You won\u2019t need the GBOverview, points and multilinestrings layers for the rest of this exercise so they can be removed . Note that removing layers from your map does just that. You are not deleting the data from your disk, they still exist, but you are removing the link between the map and your data. Right-click on the points layer (it may appear as OSM points ) Remove layer... You\u2019ll be asked to confirm that you want to remove the layer, click on OK Repeat the process with the multilinestrings and GBOverview layers. The process is identical for raster and vector layers. Ordering the layers in the Layers panel The order of the layers in the Layers panel affects how they appear on the map. Layers at the top of the list appear on top of the layers lower down. At the moment you probably have the raster-25 layer above the other layers, so you can\u2019t see them at the moment - though the labels still appear. Drag and drop the raster-25k layer from the top of the list in the Layers panel to the bottom. Again, your map will look rather a mess. Just make the following layers invisible for now. Places Line features Polygon features Tidal water You will be working with this map for the rest of the course so go to the correct area by using Type to locate to find Llanbedr Airfield . Saving your map Save your map projects at regular intervals. You will be doing a lot of work on them and can lose a lot of time if you have to do your work again because the program has crashed. Project > Save or alternatively Ctrl + S (Windows) If this is the first time you\u2019ve saved it, make sure you remember where you have saved it to and give the file a name which will help you remember what it is. It is a good idea to save all of your files to the same gis folder and make sub folders for each individual project. It is also a good idea to keep back up copies of your project and of the data files. Particularly once you start editing, problems can corrupt the whole file, so make a copy of your gis folder on a separate disk/drive/usb stick each time you finish a session working on them. Checking and setting the coordinate system The coordinate system is an important property which tells QGIS where data is located on the surface of the Earth and what measurement system is used for your datasets. It is important to have this set correctly or the layers in your map will not display correctly. If you are working in Great Britain then the coordinate system is most likely to be British National Grid, though you may also have data in the unprojected WGS 1984. For this project we will be working in British National Grid . QGIS will set the coordinate system of the map to that of the first data layer that is added. In this case it was the Places layer. Check whether the coordinate system is set correctly as follows: Go to Project > Properties and click on the CRS heading to the left This rather complex-looking dialog controls the CRS or Coordinate Reference System for the whole project. Look at the box to the left of the map - this shows that the CRS is currently set to British National Grid. The map on the right confirms that this CRS covers the correct area. It is possible to use the Filter box at the top to search for other coordinate systems, though this isn\u2019t necessary for this project. Click OK to close the project properties. If you look at the bottom right of the map window you should also see that the CRS is shown there, but this time only as a short numerical code - EPSG:27700 . If you click on this you will be taken to the CRS tab of the project properties. The final map for this chapter You should finish this chapter with a map of the Llanbedr Airfield on the Welsh coast. Your map and the rest of the project should look something like the image below, though your map may cover a slightly different area. It isn\u2019t a problem if it does. If you want me to give you feedback on this map, or on any stage of the process, please upload a screenshot to your GIS Portfolio - you\u2019ll be given instructions on how to get access to this in the class. If you upload anything please email me to let me know that you have done so. Don\u2019t forget to save and backup this project. You\u2019ll be using it for the rest of this course so make sure that you have it with you next week. Further information and suggested reading Many of the books in the reading list 3 have a general introduction to GIS which explain what it is and how it is used. Suggestions include the following: Chapter 1, What is GIS? in Heywood, I., Cornelius, S. and Carver, S. (2011), pp. 2-30 Chapter 1, Systems, Science and Study in Longley, P.A. et al. (2015), pp. 3-37 What is GIS? and some example applications ESRI UK (who publish proprietry GIS software ArcGIS) have a web page which includes an Overview of GIS and a GIS Showcase which includes examples of how GIS can be used. The webpage GIS for Science gives a lot more ideas for how GIS can be used by scientists. 7-zip is also open-source so if you want to install a copy on your own Windows computer you can - just download it from the 7-zip webpage . \u21a9 Note that these instructions are for Windows, if you are on a Mac or Linux computer you will still need to unzip the files, but I don\u2019t have access to one of these to write the instructions. \u21a9 The reading list is available in Minerva and from the library (search for the number of this module). \u21a9","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction-to-gis-with-qgis","text":"The background to GIS and an explanation of what it is will be covered in the lecture segment at the beginning of the class, and the presentation and any other supporting materials will be available in Minerva.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to Layout your maps in such a way that they effectively communicate the content and purpose of your work to a user Select relevant map elements to include in a layout and set their properties to match the requirements of your map print or export your map layout to show it to it\u2019s best advantage Introduction Once you\u2019ve put in all of the hard work to produce a map of your field area or project, it is worth making the extra effort to ensure that you lay it out clearly and print or export it in a professional fashion. Make sure that you allow the time to do this. Care and patience can make the difference between a scruffy, unimpressive map that loses you marks, and a clear, professional map that gives a good first impression and causes your audience to take your work seriously. Warning Don\u2019t underestimate the time that the final details can take and don\u2019t leave this part of the preparation until the last hour before a deadline! You won\u2019t need to use all of the elements and features outlined here for every map. Equally this is not an exhaustive list of possible elements. You should already have some idea of what elements are useful, and should be able to make a decision for each case based on your existing knowledge of maps. If you think that you need to add something that is not listed here, e.g. a report based on a table, then use the extra information available at the end of the chapter and search on-line to find out how to add it. So this chapter isn\u2019t necessarily for working through in order. Make sure that you are aware of the contents and of what QGIS is able to do, and then make your own decisions about what you need to include based on the principles that will be covered in class. Note that the examples in the images use a general map which isn\u2019t the same as the one you will be working on. The techniques and the buttons in QGIS are still the same, though. The data for this chapter You should use the map of the Llanbedr area that you have been creating in previous chapters. Try out all of the techniques listed below and then decide which you need to include on this layout before you export it. Creating and saving layouts In QGIS a print layout allows you to control the format and scale at which you print and export your map, and to lay out additional elements to complete the final product. Creating a print layout To create a new print layout Open your North Wales map project in QGIS if it isn\u2019t already open Add a print layout by going to Project > New Print Layout... You\u2019ll be asked to Enter a unique print layout title - call it something like The Gravity of the Llanbedr area, North Wales . You can leave this blank if you wish. Click OK QGIS will open your new blank layout in a new window. It should look something like the image below - though your toolbars may be in different places. In this view you will see your map laid out as it will be when it is finally printed or exported. You\u2019ll see the page outlined on screen and, once you have started adding elements you will see the content as it will look on the page. Opening existing print layouts Once you have created a print layout you can close it and open it again without losing it. Close the window containing the print layout ( Layout > Close ) To reopen it go to Project > Layouts and select your layout from the list - there is only one there at the moment so click on that. Saving layouts A layout is saved as part of the project so whenever you click on Save in your project it will save the layout too. For now: Click on the Save button in the layout window. Or Layout > Save Project Adding a map to a layout At the moment all you have is a blank page. To add a map to a layout: Click on the Add Map button on the Toolbox Or Add Item > Add Map Then use the mouse cursor to drag a box across the page. It doesn\u2019t matter about the size at the moment you can change it later. You should now be able to see a section of the map from your main project window. The Item Properties on the right will now give options for the map. You\u2019ll explore these in more detail later. Size and scale of pages and maps The size of the page and of the map \u201cwindow\u201d will affect the scale and extent of the map. These are all linked so if you change one remember to check that your map is either still at the correct scale, or still covers the correct area. Page size and orientation The page that you see in the layout window shows how the page will look when you export or print your map. Remember to check the paper size and set it correctly before you spend time arranging your layout. To change the paper size and orientation: Right-click somewhere on the \u201cpage\u201d and go to Page Properties The page properties should open in the Item Properties on the right. The Size setting allows you to choose from a wide range of standard sizes, e.g. A4, A3 etc. The Orientation setting allows you to choose between portrait and landscape orientation. You can also set the page measurements manually by changing the Width and Height in the boxes below. The page in the main view should change automatically when you change a setting. Changing paper size and orientation Change your page size and orientation to A3 Landscape. This will give you more space to experiment with adding other elements to your page. Once you have changed the paper size you may find that you can no longer see the whole page in the layout view. To zoom in or out use the buttons on the toolbar at the top. In particular use the Zoom full button. Resizing the map in a layout When you first set up a layout the size of the map may not be the size that you want it to be eventually. Changing the size of the frame is easy, but can take a little experimentation. You will also need to look at this in conjunction with the instructions on changing paper size in the previous section. Make sure that the map frame is selected in the layout by clicking on it. When the map frame is selected you should be able to see that there are small boxes at the corners and on each side. Use the boxes as \u201chandles\u201d to resize the map frame by dragging them Keep an eye on the scale in the map Item Properties. If you need to make a map at a particular scale you may need to keep putting this back to the correct scale each time you resize the map. Warning This process can take patience to get the map frame the correct size for the scale and area. There don\u2019t appear to be any short cuts so just stick with it and keep repeating the process! Moving the map within a map frame If you need to move the map itself within the frame, e.g. so that you see a different part of it: Click on the Move Item Content button on the Toolbox You\u2019ll now be able to use the mouse cursor to move the map around within the frame. Remember to click back onto the Select/Move Item button to be able to select items again. Controlling the map with the Item Properties If the map is selected on the layout you will see its properties in the Item Properties panel on the right. You can use these to control various settings for the map. The ones you need to know now are: The most obvious is Scale . Use this box to type the scale that you want your map to print at. Extents is useful if you don\u2019t need to worry about the scale, but do need to show a map covering a particular area. You can type the east, south, west and north coordinates and the map frame will change accordingly. The Frame setting allows you to put an outline around the outside of your map. This can make the map look more professional. Adding items to a layout The information below includes details on adding many different items to a layout. Not all of these will be appropriate to every layout, but it is up to you to decide which items to use depending on the purpose and audience of your map and any guidelines specified for assessments or reports. Some of the references on the reading list, particularly Darkes and Spence (2017), should help you with this. Remember that the QGIS Documentation will provide you with plenty of extra information on how to add items to a layout. Most items are added to a layout in a similar way to each other using the buttons on the Toolbox. In most cases you\u2019ll then be able to use the Item Properties to make changes to the item. Selecting items on a layout There are a couple of ways of selecting items on a layout. Click the Select/Move Item button on the Toolbox then click on the item you wish to select Alternatively use the Items panel. As you add more items to your map they will be added to this panel. All you need to do then is click on them in this list to select them on the map. You can also use the items panel to lock items in place and make them invisible. Once an item is selected it will have the little \u201chandles\u201d visible for resizing. A legend or key You will have added various data to your map and it is necessary for you to explain to anyone looking at your map what those layers and symbols show. To do this you\u2019ll need to add a legend or key. Start by using the default options to create a legend. Once you have the basic legend it is possible to make alterations later. Warning Save your map and take a backup copy of your project folder before you start doing this. While it is usually fine, if you have a lot of big layers on your map QGIS can crash when you first add a key and you don\u2019t want to lose the work you\u2019ve already done. There are ways to get around this if you have this problem. To add a legend / key: Click on the Add Legend button on the Toolbox Click on your layout in roughly the location that you want your legend to appear. You can move and resize it later. You can also \u201cdrag\u201d the box to the correct size as you add it. If the New Item Properties dialog appears click OK QGIS will add a legend which includes all of the items from all of the layers on your map. This is likely to be rather a lot! The first thing to do is to remove any that you don\u2019t need. As usual, while the legend is selected, the Item Properties will show the specific properties for this element. In the Item Properties start by checking that the legend is referring to the correct map on your layout - use the dropdown box next to Map to select the correct one if you have more than one. You can give your legend / key a title if you wish, but note that this isn\u2019t always necessary. Then move down to the Legend Items heading If you don\u2019t want all of your layers to appear then untick Auto update - you can always click on the Update All button later if you change symbols etc on your map. Now you can select layers and then click on the red minus button under the list to remove them. To only show elements which appear on your map tick next to Only show items inside linked map - this can be a great help to remove surplus symbols. Once you have just the layers that you want on your key you can then use the rest of the properties to set fonts, backgrounds etc. It is possible to drag and drop the layers in the Items list and rearrange them. The Columns section allows you to split your legend into two or more columns. The Symbol section will let you change the size of symbol, or patch, on the legend - sometimes it is useful to be able to enlarge the \u201cpatch\u201d. To change layer names in the legend without changing them on your map you can select the item in the list and click on the pencil icon below. Alternatively you can change the names in the Layers panel in map view then click on the Refresh button in layout view to refresh the map and all associated items. There is a limit to what you can do with the automatic functions and properties. Do as much as you can. Once you have finalised everything on your layout it is possible to export the map as pdf or svg format then edit the legend in a vector graphics editing program such as Inkscape, CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator. Preventing the legend from crashing QGIS If you have a problem with adding a legend causing QGIS to crash try the following: Open a new, empty project in QGIS Create a new layout as you did above. Add a legend to the layout. Untick the box in the legend properties that says auto-update It\u2019s a good idea to add a title and a frame to the legend so that you can find it again! Save the layout as a template ( Save as template button on the toolbar) Close the blank project and reopen your real project Create a new layout use the template that you saved by doing the following: Project > Layout Manager Under New from Template select Specific from the dropdown then click on the three dots button next to the blank field Select the template that you just created and Open Click on the Create... button and you\u2019ll be asked for a name for your layout Once you have the layout open add a map frame. You\u2019ll then need to associate the map frame with the legend by selecting the legend and setting the Map to the correct map. Now use the + (plus) button below the Legend Items to add the layers that you do want to be included. Ticking Only show items inside linked map will also help. This is a fiddle and not ideal, but if it stops your QGIS project from crashing hopefully it is worth it! Scale bar and scale text Some indication of scale should always be added to both printed and screen maps. A scale bar is a useful convention for both. Scale text (e.g. 1:50,000 or 1 cm = 1 km) is only relevant for printed maps, not for maps on screen where someone can zoom to any scale. If you add scale text you must also ensure that you print or export the map at the correct scale. To add a scale bar Click on Add Scale Bar on the Toolbox Click on the layout in roughly the position you want the scale bar (you can always move it later) Select OK on the New Item Properties box that pops up The scale bar should appear on your layout. You can now go to the Item Properties to change various parameters. The Map dropdown is where you check that the scale bar is set for the correct map Use the Style dropdown to select how you want the scale bar to appear - try a few of these and see what effect they have The Scalebar units should be set to something appropriate for your map You can use the settings under Segments to change the length and intervals of your scale bar. Try these out and see what happens. There are a lot more settings so just explore these and see what they do. In particular you may want to change the Font under the Display settings. You can always remove the scale bar and start again! To add scale text Click on Add Scale Bar on the Toolbox Click on the layout in roughly the position you want the scale bar (you can always move it later) Select OK on the New Item Properties box that pops up A scale bar should appear on your layout. You can now go to the Item Properties to change this to numbers. The Map dropdown is where you check that the scale text is set for the correct map Use the Style dropdown to select Numeric The text should appear and automatically match the scale of your map. There are far fewer options for this - mainly just the Font settings. Text or labels Text is an essential part of any map layout. Maps need an informative title to show the audience what the map is about. You should include your name (or for an assessment your student ID) as creator of the map. Copyright statements are essential if you have used data from other sources and you may also want to include acknowledgements and further explanations of your maps and data. There are two main ways to add text, static text and dynamic text. The instructions for static text are shown below. Dynamic is more complex and won\u2019t be covered here. If you are interested in using it you can look at the tutorial on Creating a Dynamic Print Layout in the QGIS Training Manual. Static text Static text is text that you type into the box on the Item Properties. This stays the same once you have added it. Most of the text that you add to your layout will be of this type. For example, a title or subtitles to individual maps, your name or ID as the creator of the map, copyright text etc. To add static text: Click on the Add Label button on the Toolbox Click on your layout in roughly the location that you want your text to appear. You can move and resize it later. You can also \u201cdrag\u201d the box to the correct size as you add it. If the New Item Properties dialog appears click OK A new label item should appear on your layout. By default the text will be \u201cLorem Ipsum\u201d (placeholder text). Type your text in the box on the Item Properties panel The options on the panel will also allow you to change the font, font size and colour, the alignment, and add a frame. Copyright acknowledgements Copyright is important. Remember that most data providers ask you to sign up to conditions that include an obligation to add a copyright acknowledgement to your map. Check what that copyright statement is and make sure that you add it. For example, when you signed up to use the Digimap collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. These acknowledgements do change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check what they are for yourself. To find the Digimap copyright acknowledgements go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements and click on it. Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used. Some of these are pdf documents that you need to download. Then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text. For example, from April 2019, when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your map. \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year . Ordnance Survey (100025252). Where year is replaced by the current year. Remember that you do have to acknowledge each different dataset that you use and will have signed up to that when your registered. Adding the copyright symbol to your text To add the copyright symbol (\u00a9) to your text (Windows computers) Check that the Num lock is on on the keyboard Hold down the Alt key Use the number pad to type 0 + 1 + 6 + 9 Release the Alt key If you are not using U.K. Ordnance Survey data this is not the correct copyright acknowledgement to use. For example, if you are using data for Spain or the United States, or indeed UK data that you haven\u2019t downloaded from Digimap. You\u2019ll need to find the correct copyright acknowledgement for yourself. You can often find this sort of information on files that come with the data or on the webpage you downloaded it from. Digimap also give advice on citing Digimap data as opposed to the copyright acknowledgement. GIS Lounge have an article about How to Cite GIS Materials which includes the software as well as the data and the maps. A measured grid Measured grids add labelled grid lines to a map. If you are using Ordnance Survey or other UK data projected in British National Grid then you can easily add National Grid lines and numbers to your map. The O.S. Raster tiff files already have grid lines marked, but adding a measured grid allows you to include coordinates around the edge of your map - making it possible to read grid references. Click on the map to which you want to add grid lines. In the Item Properties scroll down until you reach the Grids heading and click on the little arrow next to it. Click on the + (plus) button below the Grids heading to add a Grid to the list below. Select the Grid in the list and click on Modify Grid... The Item Properties will change to show the properties for the grid. Under Interval set the X and Y boxes to the interval that you want between the lines. This depends on the scale of your map and you can experiment to see what looks best and would be most useful. For now try 1000 - this is in map units which for British National Grid will be metres. The lines are often too bold, so click on the Line style dropdown and select a paler shade of grey. You could also make the lines thinner. Scroll down and tick next to Draw Coordinates - this adds the numbers. I usually change the Left and Right coordinates from Horizontal to Vertical so that they follow the edge of the frame. Alter the Font as you wish - don\u2019t make the coordinates large. They need to be visible, but not intrusive. Change the Coordinate precision to 0 Note that the grid that QGIS adds is fully numeric, you may be more used to seeing grid letters for 100 km grid squares, e.g. the University grid reference is similar to SE 2934 3444, the University grid coordinates are similar to 42934 43444. It is the latter that will appear on a measured grid generated by QGIS. North arrows Before adding a north arrow to your layout stop and think about how you need to indicate north on your map. If you look at the technical information on an Ordnance Survey Landranger (1:50 000) map you\u2019ll see a diagram showing Grid north, True north and Magnetic North. The information given there shows how to plot the difference of magnetic north from grid north. Adding this to your own maps can be useful, particularly if you, or anyone else, are going to be using the map in the field. If you are taking strike and dip measurements in the field you should have corrected your compass-clino for declination (the horizontal angular difference between true north and magnetic north) anyway. When you plot the measurements on your map it isn\u2019t worth worrying too much about whether you are plotting against grid or true north as the difference on any grid, not just the British National Grid, is unlikely to be that big. See the image below for the different types of north and the declination. Labelling north arrows If you add any north arrows to your layout do remember to label them in some way which shows which version of north each one is showing. North arrow: Grid north / Map north If a map is in a projected coordinate system QGIS will automatically lay it out aligned with the grid. So for example, any map set to British National Grid will be aligned to grid north. In this case it isn\u2019t strictly necessary to add a north arrow to show grid north if you also include a measured grid on your map, but it doesn\u2019t hurt. Click on the Add North Arrow button on the Toolbox Click on your layout in roughly the location that you want your legend to appear. You can move and resize it later. You can also \u201cdrag\u201d the box to the correct size as you add it. If the New Item Properties dialog appears click OK QGIS will add a default north arrow to your layout and open the Item Properties. Under Picture check that SVG image is selected In the box below scroll down to svg > arrows to select a different north arrow. Note that it\u2019s usually a good idea to keep these simple. Change the colours and stroke width under SVG Parameters if required Under Image Rotation the North alignment should be set to Grid North by default - if it isn\u2019t set that now. If you check this against your measured grid lines you should find that it matches exactly. North arrow: True north True north is the direction from the area of your map to the North Pole. In the east/west centre of a grid, such as that set for the British National Grid, it may well be the same as grid north, e.g. in Leeds the difference is extremely slight. As you go further east or west towards the edges of an area covered by a grid the difference becomes more noticeable, e.g. at Lands End in Cornwall, or in Norfolk. Click on the Add North Arrow button on the Toolbox Click on your layout in roughly the location that you want your legend to appear. You can move and resize it later. You can also \u201cdrag\u201d the box to the correct size as you add it. If the New Item Properties dialog appears click OK QGIS will add a default north arrow to your layout and open the Item Properties. Under Picture check that SVG image is selected In the box below scroll down to svg > arrows to select a different north arrow. Note that it\u2019s usually a good idea to keep these simple. Change the colours and stroke width under SVG Parameters if required Under Image Rotation set the North alignment to True north You should see the rotation in the box above change to a slightly different number. If you check this north arrow against your measured grid lines you may well find that the north arrow is slightly tilted. North arrow: Magnetic north calculated by grid magnetic angle Magnetic north is the direction from the area of your map to the magnetic north pole. This is the number that is given on the corner of Ordnance Survey maps and the one geologists need for setting their compass-clinos in the field, so it is worth making a note of this on your map too. Finding the grid magnetic angle First you need to find the grid magnetic angle. Go to the Grid Magnetic Model 2020 Calculator on the BGS Geomagnetism Group web pages fill in the form - you can get the British National Grid in metres coordinates by looking at your map in QGIS. The coordinates at the tip of the cursor are shown at the bottom of the map. Once you submit the form you will be shown the result in text which includes magnetic north and the date - make a note of both of these. The website above will only give you the grid magnetic angle for the UK. To set magnetic north on a layout Click on the Add North Arrow button on the Toolbox Click on your layout in roughly the location that you want your legend to appear. You can move and resize it later. You can also \u201cdrag\u201d the box to the correct size as you add it. If the New Item Properties dialog appears click OK QGIS will add a default north arrow to your layout and open the Item Properties. Under Picture check that SVG image is selected In the box below scroll down to svg > arrows to select a different north arrow. Note that it\u2019s usually a good idea to keep these simple. Change the colours and stroke width under SVG Parameters if required Under Image Rotation set the North alignment to Grid north as grid magnetic angle is the angle from Grid north to Magnetic north. In the Offset field enter the angle that you obtained from the BGS website. If the angle was EAST of grid north enter a positive figure, if WEST enter a negative figure. Don\u2019t forget to add text to your map showing the date of the reading. It changes with time. For more about how the magnetic north pole is moving see the BGS blog . Multiple maps on one page It can be very useful to be able to place more than one map or map view on a single page, either so that you can show a different area, or a different zoom level for the same area. You can also use this to set up an automatic extent indicator which marks your study area on a map of a country. Different areas of the same map You can add multiple maps to your layout using the Add Map command in the same way you added a single map earlier. If you add them directly both maps will show the same data and styling. You can then change the scale and extent on each one individually using the Item Properties and the Move Item Content button. Maps showing different content If you want to add further maps to your layout but have them showing different content you can do that too. Select the initial map frame on the layout Make sure that it shows the content that you want it to show and it is all styled correctly In the Item Properties go to the Layers subheading and tick on Lock layers Once you\u2019ve done that you\u2019ll have the option to tick Lock styles for layers too. This stops your styles from changing if you change them in the main map. Now go back in to the map view and set up the map and layers so that they are as you want them for the second map. Back in layout view add a new map frame as before . This should reflect the map that you have open in the map view now. Once you are happy with this view in the Item Properties go to the Layers subheading and tick on Lock layers Once you\u2019ve done that you\u2019ll have the option to tick Lock styles for layers too. This stops your styles from changing if you change them in the main map. As both of your maps are locked you will have to remember to unlock them if you need to make any changes to the styles or combinations of layers. Extent indicator or locator map For some maps, particularly large scale (detailed) maps of very small areas, it is useful to show a small scale map of the general area with the area of the main map marked, as in the figure below. To do this you need to obtain small scale data and add it to your map. You really only need a general map, even just an outline of a whole country, so it can be best to use data from Natural Earth . Download the Countries data from Medium scale data, 1:50m > Cultural > Admin 0 - Countries - click on the Download countries button to download a zip file containing a shapefile. Using a screenshot from Google Earth or Google Maps (or similar) with a marker on it doesn\u2019t look professional and should be avoided. Not least it is surprisingly easy to end up with the marker in the wrong place. Note that the extent indicator does not need to be large, but should be a small map which doesn\u2019t take up too much space on the layout. Set up your main map and lock the layers on the layout. Add the Countries outline to your map and turn off the other layers Symbolise the countries as a thin black outline and zoom in to the country containing your study area Add a new map to your layout and resize it as appropriate so that it shows the country as a small map. Make sure that the small map is selected then go to the Item Properties panel Scroll down to the Overviews section and click on the little arrow next to it to open it out Click on the + (plus) button then select the new Overview title that appears Check that Draw \"Overview 1\" overview (or whatever your new Overview is called) is ticked. The properties to change how the overview looks are below. Under Map frame select your main map - the one of the smaller area. Set the Frame style as you wish. If you can\u2019t see the frame on the indicator map because it is too small I found that setting the Simple fill Stroke style to Solid Line in the Symbol Settings then giving it a thicker Stroke width and setting the Join style to Round gave the effect of a dot on the map. You should now have a map with a marker showing the location covered by your main map. If you move the main map the \u201cframe\u201d on the smaller map will automatically update to reflect the new location. Inserting photographs and images You may want to include photographs and diagrams on your map layouts. Geological cross-sections will come under this category too. To add a raster image This includes photographs or any image in a format such as jpg, png, tiff, gif. Click on the Add Picture button on the Toolbox Click on your layout in roughly the location that you want your legend to appear. You can move and resize it later. You can also \u201cdrag\u201d the box to the correct size as you add it. If the New Item Properties dialog appears click OK QGIS will add a blank picture place holder to your layout and open the Item Properties. In the Item Properties click to add a Raster Image Use the three dots button to navigate to and select your picture file then click Open Your picture should appear on your layout. As usual you can resize it and move it on the layout and change the properties in Item Properties To add an SVG image SVG stands for Scaleable Vector Graphics. It is the native editing format for the vector graphics program Inkscape . If you have used Inkscape to draw your diagrams you can import them as follows: Click on the Add Picture button on the Toolbox Click on your layout in roughly the location that you want your legend to appear. You can move and resize it later. You can also \u201cdrag\u201d the box to the correct size as you add it. If the New Item Properties dialog appears click OK QGIS will add a blank picture place holder to your layout and open the Item Properties. In the Item Properties click to add a SVG Image Use the three dots button to navigate to and select your picture file then click Open Your picture should appear on your layout. As usual you can resize it and move it on the layout and change the properties in Item Properties Warning Unfortunately svg images with gradient fills don\u2019t seem to work well in QGIS. In many cases it will be better to export your diagram from Inkscape as a png file then import that to QGIS as a raster image. Alternatively you can export the layout from QGIS when you have finished adding all of the map elements and then open it in Inkscape and add your diagrams there. This is usually a better option and instructions will be given for exporting from QGIS later in this chapter. Checking your map Checking your map is a very important stage but one that can easily be forgotten if you are in a hurry. In addition to the points below have a look at Darkes (2017) which gives a lot of quick tips on map layout and presentation. On pages 92 and 93 Darkes includes a section with quick wins for improving your map before publication if you have 5, 15 or 50 minutes. Suggestions for things to check Check spelling. It\u2019s easy to miss something obvious so if possible print your map out, or put it on screen and stand back a bit then have a look at it. In particular check geological and geographical names and any technical terms. Check that you have included everything you need to include. If this is an assignment reread the instructions and check that you haven\u2019t forgotten to do anything. Check that your map doesn\u2019t include anything that you don\u2019t want to include! Did you add some experimental polygons when you were editing, then forgot to delete them? Have you added text boxes and then not removed any that you don\u2019t need? Look at the article on Using a mapmaking checklist for map design on the ESRI blog. Read about what makes a map great, then click on the link to the checklist and use the questions there to evaluate your own map. Have you included everything you need to include, or do you have a good reason if something is not on your map? Have you taken care with your presentation? Printing a copy to pdf to check Almost inevitably you\u2019ll notice something not quite right with your map after you have printed it. To minimize the chances of this happening if you are printing an expensive A0 copy it is a good idea to print your map at A3 and have a close look at it. This isn\u2019t such an issue if your map is only A3 or A4 when full size. Export your layout as a pdf file following the instructions below. Open your pdf map file in your usual pdf reader (instructions below are for Acrobat Reader but you should be able to find similar commands in other programs) File > Print Choose your printer and use the printer properties to set the paper size to A3 then choose to print in colour. In the Page Handling section set Page Scaling to Fit to Printable Area . In Acrobat this should show you a small preview of how your file will print. When you are happy with the settings send your file to the printer. Printing and exporting map layouts When you have finished creating your map layout in QGIS you will often need to export it to pdf for printing. The following instructions should help to ensure that your map is the correct size and scale. Printing a map layout from QGIS The best quality output is probably obtained by printing directly from QGIS, though this isn\u2019t always possible. If it is, print as follows: Start by checking that the page size and the map scale are correct. Go to Layout > Page Setup and check that the paper size matches the size you set in the layout properties. Then Layout > Print to actually print your map. You\u2019ll need to set up the printer as you usually would. This is system and printer specific so I can\u2019t include fuller instructions here. Exporting a map layout from QGIS Exporting to pdf These instructions show you how to export the map to pdf - the format that is usually required if you are having the map professionally printed. Start by checking that the page size and the map scale are correct. You should also check the Export Settings under Layout (the next tab to the left of the Item Properties. Check that the Resolution is set appropriately - too high and you\u2019ll have an enormous file, too low and the print quality won\u2019t be good. Try 300 dpi and see how that goes. In a layout go to Layout > Export as PDF... or click the button on the toolbar. Select where you want to save your output and give it a name Then click on Save The PDF Export Options should open. The defaults are fine, so stick with those Click Save to export the pdf. You should get a message saying that your layout was successfully exported. At this stage open the pdf and make sure it looks as you expect it to. Important note on printing a map layout from pdf If you are printing your final copy from pdf double-check in the pdf reader you use that the Page Scaling or Zoom is set to Actual size... or None . The actual terminology depends on which pdf application you are using. This is important to ensure that your map is printed at the scale at which you intend it to be printed. This is particularly important if you are printing maps to be used as field slips. Major problems with measurements can be caused if your map is reduced by even a tiny amount. Importing a pdf map layout in to Inkscape Export pdf and import to Inkscape It is possible to export a map layout to svg which would work in Inkscape, but at the moment the export is rather unreliable. If you want to open your map layout in Inkscape to finish it off it is better to export pdf and import that to Inkscape. If you are importing the pdf in to Inkscape and if your map is going to be part of a bigger presentation where scale is important, such as the Geology degree final dissertation map, be very careful to import it without changing scale, size or proportions. The Interactive Inkscape exercises 1 have a section on how to import a map layout. Exporting a map to import to Word and PowerPoint You can also export the layout to include in programs such as Word or PowerPoint if you are intending it to accompany a report. Start by checking that the page size and the map scale are correct. You should also check the Export Settings under Layout (the next tab to the left of the Item Properties. Check that the Resolution is set appropriately - too high and you\u2019ll have an enormous file, too low and the print quality won\u2019t be good. Try 300 dpi and see how that goes. In a layout go to Layout > Export as image or click the button on the toolbar. The Image Export Options will open. This gives you another chance to check the resolution. It\u2019s usually worth ticking Enable antialiasing - but if your map looks very blurred it will be worth trying again with this unticked. If you are likely to want to open your output in GIS again click to Generate world file Click Save and wait for your file to be exported. You\u2019ll get a message when it finishes. Be aware that it is a good idea to create your layout at the correct size in QGIS before you export it. You can resize jpg or png files in Word and PowerPoint but you\u2019ll lose some of the quality. Recommended reading: layout and presentation The following references from the reading list 2 will give you information on the principles behind producing a professional layout. Darkes and Spence (2017) - large parts of this book are particularly relevant but it is formatted as a quick reference guide so it\u2019s easy to get quick information about what ever you are looking for. If you can\u2019t get hold of the 2017 version the link to the downloadable pdf of the 2011 edition is available on the reading list too. Particularly useful in the Darkes and Spence book are the pages at the end titled \u201cBetter mapping in 5, 15 and 50 minutes\u201d. The article by Frye (2001) gives you quick information about communicating with maps. Further information and inspiration For examples and ideas look at the ESRI Map Book Gallery . The British Geological Survey printed maps are available online via the BGS Maps Portal and it\u2019s worth having a look at the layout of some of the more modern sheets, such as the Glossop sheet or the Bath sheet .

Warning Save your map and take a backup copy of your project folder before you start doing this. While it is usually fine, if you have a lot of big layers on your map QGIS can crash when you first add a key and you don\u2019t want to lose the work you\u2019ve already done. There are ways to get around this if you have this problem. To add a legend / key: Click on the Add Legend button on the Toolbox Click on your layout in roughly the location that you want your legend to appear. You can move and resize it later. You can also \u201cdrag\u201d the box to the correct size as you add it. If the New Item Properties dialog appears click OK QGIS will add a legend which includes all of the items from all of the layers on your map. This is likely to be rather a lot! The first thing to do is to remove any that you don\u2019t need. As usual, while the legend is selected, the Item Properties will show the specific properties for this element. In the Item Properties start by checking that the legend is referring to the correct map on your layout - use the dropdown box next to Map to select the correct one if you have more than one. You can give your legend / key a title if you wish, but note that this isn\u2019t always necessary. Then move down to the Legend Items heading If you don\u2019t want all of your layers to appear then untick Auto update - you can always click on the Update All button later if you change symbols etc on your map. Now you can select layers and then click on the red minus button under the list to remove them. To only show elements which appear on your map tick next to Only show items inside linked map - this can be a great help to remove surplus symbols. Once you have just the layers that you want on your key you can then use the rest of the properties to set fonts, backgrounds etc. It is possible to drag and drop the layers in the Items list and rearrange them. The Columns section allows you to split your legend into two or more columns. The Symbol section will let you change the size of symbol, or patch, on the legend - sometimes it is useful to be able to enlarge the \u201cpatch\u201d. To change layer names in the legend without changing them on your map you can select the item in the list and click on the pencil icon below. Alternatively you can change the names in the Layers panel in map view then click on the Refresh button in layout view to refresh the map and all associated items. There is a limit to what you can do with the automatic functions and properties. Do as much as you can.

For example, when you signed up to use the Digimap collections you agreed to add copyright acknowledgements whenever you created a map with the data. These acknowledgements do change from time to time so it\u2019s worth knowing how to check what they are for yourself. To find the Digimap copyright acknowledgements go to the Digimap Resource Centre ( Resources at the top of the main Digimap page) Look for a link to Digimap Licence Agreements and click on it. Click on the End User or Sub-licence agreement for the data that you\u2019ve used. Some of these are pdf documents that you need to download. Then look for the information under In return, you must: - that gives you the acknowledgement text. For example, from April 2019, when you use Ordnance Survey data obtained from Digimap you are expected to add the following text to your map. \u00a9 Crown copyright and database rights year .

The information given there shows how to plot the difference of magnetic north from grid north. Adding this to your own maps can be useful, particularly if you, or anyone else, are going to be using the map in the field. If you are taking strike and dip measurements in the field you should have corrected your compass-clino for declination (the horizontal angular difference between true north and magnetic north) anyway. When you plot the measurements on your map it isn\u2019t worth worrying too much about whether you are plotting against grid or true north as the difference on any grid, not just the British National Grid, is unlikely to be that big.

Learning outcomes When you have completed this section of the workbook you should be able to demonstrate how to import height data in to GIS display a map in 3D to aid the interpretation of your data extrude vector data for 3D display based on a value from the attribute table Introduction Once you have created features and data in GIS you can view the map in 3D and see how your data relates to other features. You\u2019ll be able to export 3D views from QGIS to include in other reports and layouts. Data to download Borehole data Download the Boreholes.csv file from Minerva and load into QGIS using the instructions you used to load the gravity data points . Download DTM files from Digimap You\u2019ll need to obtain height data from Digimap and merge the tiles for use in QGIS. DTM stands for Digital Terrain Model. You may also come across DEM which stands for Digital Elevation Model. There are differences in the data but both can be treated in the same way. Use Digimap O.S. Data Download Search for Llanbedr - it\u2019s the one in Gwynedd - and download data for at least the area shown below (a bit more than this doesn\u2019t matter, but don\u2019t download too much or the processing will take ages): When selecting data products go to Land and Height Data and select OS Terrain 5 DTM - make sure you select the DTM not the contours. Once you have the data in the basket select the download format as ASC Save the resulting download to your disk and unzip it. Producing \u201cseamless\u201d datasets from more than one tile of dtm data If you are using more than one tile of dtm data (which you should be for this exercise) follow the instructions below to combine the multiple files into one single one. This will make it possible to use the files as a continuous surface in maps and 3D scenes. During this process we will also convert the multiple asc or tif files into one single tiff file. If QGIS isn\u2019t already open, open it now. Use the Browser panel to find the dtm files that you downloaded from Digimap and check the Layer Properties of one of the .asc files. In particular look for the CRS and the Data type and make a note of both then close the layer properties. Go to Raster > Miscellaneous > Merge... This opens one of the QGIS tools. In the Merge dialog click on the three dots button next to the Input Layers Click on Add File(s)... and navigate to the folder containing your dtm data Use the dropdown next to File name: to select Arc/Info ASCII Grid (*.asc *.ASC) - this will restrict the files that you\u2019ll see to just that extension Add all of the files with an extension of .asc by selecting them and clicking on Open . They should appear on a list and each of them should be ticked. Click on OK to add them to the tool. The Input layers field of the Merge dialog should now tell you the number of input layers that you have added. For the Output data type select the data type that you found in the Layer Properties above. In my case this is Float64 Go down to the Merged field which currently says [Save to temporary file] and use the button at the end of the field to select Save to file... Browse to the folder in which you want to store the file and give it a name, such as MergedDTM The file will automatically be given the extension of tif Click Save Then click to Run The tool should run and add a new layer to your map. You can Close the dialog when it runs successfully. Check that the file looks OK, and also check that the coordinate reference system is set correctly Right-click on the layer and go to Properties Look at the Information tab and check that the CRS is correct. If it isn\u2019t you will need to reproject the file to the same CRS as your map . You don\u2019t need this layer to be visible so move it to the bottom of the list in the Layers panel and turn it off. Creating a profile graph QGIS enables you to draw a profile graph across your map using z values in your surface raster files or heights above sea-level. You now have both of these layers on your map so can try both of them. You\u2019ll need to start by installing the Profile tool plugin by going to Plugins > Plugin Manager in the same way as you installed the QuickMapServices plugin . Once you have the plugin installed you will gain a button on the toolbar which has the tooltip Terrain profile Click on the Terrain Profile button The Profile Tool window should open at the bottom of your screen. The first thing you need to do is select the layer that contains your z or height data. In this case you have two possible layers on your map. Select your gravity surface in the Layers panel - mine is called IDWgrav yours may be something different On the Profile Tool panel click Add Layer under the box on the right - the layer should appear in the box Now check that under Options the Selection is set to Temporary polyline Left-click somewhere on the map on the west of your gravity layer Then double-click (to end the line) somewhere on the east of your gravity layer Immediately a profile should be drawn in the window on the Profile tool panel. Adding a second elevation surface Now try adding the MergedDTM layer too (you may have called it something different). You do it in exactly the same way, except that you already have a line across your map. If you click on the colour patch next to the MergedDTM layer you can change it to a different colour so you can see which profile refers to which data surface. Unfortunately it isn\u2019t possible to edit the y axes independently so that you have the two profiles on different scales. For the assessment you only need to include the profile across the gravity surface, so for now click on Remove Layer and remove the DTM layer. Using a feature class for the line on the map So far you\u2019ve only used a temporary line on the map for the line of the profile. When you close your map this line will disappear. If you are going to include the profile on the map layout you also need to show the line of the profile on the map. To do this you can create a feature class and digitise a line across the map . Refer back to the chapter on Creating data by digitising for a reminder of how to do this. Once you have a digitised line Select the line layer in the Layers panel and then use Select Features by Area or Single Click from the toolbar at the top to click on the line and select it (it should turn bright yellow) Open the Profile Graph panel and add your gravity surface as before Under Selection click on Selected polyline or Selected layer The Profile should appear in the window to the left. Saving the profile graph You can save your profile graph to an image to add to other work It\u2019s a good idea to untick Show Cursor before you save the graph Use the dropdown at the bottom of the profile to select Graph - PNG Then click on the Save as button Navigate to where you want to save the graph and give it a name. The result png file can be added to reports or map layouts - but see below. If you have selected a line on the map it is a good idea to Clear selections once you have saved the graph. Adding annotation to a profile graph This plugin is fairly basic. It simply allows you to draw a line across a map and show the profile. If you are going to include a profile graph on a map layout or in a report you will need to annotate it with titles, labels etc. To do this you need to save the graph as SVG format It\u2019s a good idea to untick Show Cursor before you save the graph Use the dropdown at the bottom of the profile to select Graph - SVG Then click on the Save as button Navigate to where you want to save the graph and give it a name. Once you have the SVG format graph you can open it in a vector graphics program, such as Inkscape 1 , CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator, then edit it as required. Further information For a video on the Profile plugin see Using the Profile Tool plugin in QGIS by Hans van der Kwast. Viewing 3D topography in QGIS Sometimes being able to view your data in 3D can really help you to interpret it. QGIS has a couple of effective ways of allowing you to do this. Start with your map set up to show the 1:25 000 background map and the gravity surface. Make sure you have the merged DTM in your project, but it doesn\u2019t need to be visible. 3D Map View The simplest way to view a map in 3D is to use the inbuilt tool. This is fine, but fairly limited. Click on View > New 3D Map View On my computer this always opens far too small so I have to use the mouse to extend the window. The initial view looks the same as the map in the main view. You have to tell it where to get the 3D elevation data from. Click on the button with the little spanner on the toolbar - this gives you the 3D Configuration window. Select Terrain Drop down the Type box and select DEM (Raster Layer) In the Elevation box select your merged DTM layer. Click OK You should notice a slight difference, but as you are still looking down on the view from above you won\u2019t see the full 3D effect yet. Use the mouse wheel and buttons, or the controls in the top right of the window to have a look at your 3D scene. You can try out some of the other settings from the 3D Configuration settings to see what happens. It is possible to export this view as an image click on the Save as image... button on the toolbar. Close the view by clicking on the cross at top right. The Qgis2threejs plugin QGIS has a plugin which gives more options for viewing your data in 3D, including extruding vector layers, and it is worth installing this and trying it out. Installing the plugin Install the Qgis2threejs plugin in the same way you\u2019ve used for other plugins Creating a 3D view Warning Note that if you have already run the QGIS 3D viewer you will need to close it, then close QGIS and reopen your map before you run the Qgis2threejs plugin. You can open the plugin either by clicking on the button on the toolbar or by going to Web > Qgis2threejs > Qgis2threejs Exporter The window that opens will have a blank main window and a list of your layers on the left. Under the DEM heading in the layers on the left click to put a tick next to your merged DTM layer (remember to some extent DEM and DTM are the same thing). Your map should appear and should already be shown as a 3D view. Use your mouse to navigate in the scene. The mouse wheel will let you zoom in and out. If you click on the map you get a pop-up menu with the coordinates at that point and an option to zoom in to that point or orbit around it (press Esc to stop orbiting). Just have a go! Press F5 (reset) to get back to the original view Go to Scene > Scene settings... . In this view you can change the Vertical exaggeration - set it to 3.0 and click Apply to see what happens. Use this setting with care - for a scientific map it\u2019s usually best to stay at 1.0 which is the actual vertical setting. Exporting an image Once you have a view that shows your data in a way that will enhance the interpretation you can export it as an image. The image can then be included in reports and map layouts. File > Save Scene as... > Image (.png) You can change the output size here if you wish, then click on Save Navigate to wherever you wish to save the image and give it a name then click on Save . Extruding vector layers It is possible to show vector layers in 3D. A popular use for this is to extrude building polygons if you have the height of the roof. In this case we\u2019ll extrude the depth of boreholes for this area. At the beginning of this chapter you downloaded borehole data for Llanbedr from Minerva in the form of a csv file. If you haven\u2019t already added this to your map do so now. Remember that you\u2019ll need to add this in the same way that you did the gravity points . Have a look at the attribute table and in particular the LENGTH field - this is the depth of the borehole below ground-level. Now you have the vector layer ready to extrude. Open the Qgis2threejs plugin again. Your borehole layer should be visible in the left-hand menu now. Put a tick in the box next to the layer. You should be able to see a series of spheres above your map. Right-click on the boreholes layer in the Layers list and go to Properties Change the Object type to Cylinder Under Z coordinate change Mode to Relative to \"MergedDTM\" layer (or whatever your DTM layer is called) Under Style you can change the colour and opacity Under the Height box drop down the box and select the HEIGHT field If you click Apply now you should see your points extruded above the map. But these are boreholes - they should go downwards\u2026 The Height field is set to Expression so there is an E symbol on a button to the right of the field. Click on this now and enter the following expression. \u201cLENGTH\u201d * -1 Once you\u2019ve done that click OK and then click on OK again. Your cylinders should disappear leaving only a patch on the terrain. If you use the mouse to navigate to under the land surface you will be able to see the longest borehole - this is the Mochras Borehole . But what about the others? Right-click on the DTM layer in the Layers list and go to Properties Untick Build sides and tick Build frame Click OK Your scene should redraw and you should be able to see all of the points extruded downwards. You can make these more obvious by changing the expression in the properties of the point layer to increase all of them, e.g. by doing * -2 instead of * -1 , but that does make the Mochras Borehole very long indeed! Again, this can be exported as an image by going to File > Save scene as... > Image (.png) . Further information If you want to find out more about Qgis2threejs see the tutorial by Alasdair Rae .

This will make it possible to use the files as a continuous surface in maps and 3D scenes. During this process we will also convert the multiple asc or tif files into one single tiff file. If QGIS isn\u2019t already open, open it now. Use the Browser panel to find the dtm files that you downloaded from Digimap and check the Layer Properties of one of the .asc files. In particular look for the CRS and the Data type and make a note of both then close the layer properties. Go to Raster > Miscellaneous > Merge... This opens one of the QGIS tools. In the Merge dialog click on the three dots button next to the Input Layers Click on Add File(s)... and navigate to the folder containing your dtm data Use the dropdown next to File name: to select Arc/Info ASCII Grid (*.asc *.ASC) - this will restrict the files that you\u2019ll see to just that extension Add all of the files with an extension of .asc by selecting them and clicking on Open . They should appear on a list and each of them should be ticked. Click on OK to add them to the tool. The Input layers field of the Merge dialog should now tell you the number of input layers that you have added. For the Output data type select the data type that you found in the Layer Properties above.

You now have both of these layers on your map so can try both of them. You\u2019ll need to start by installing the Profile tool plugin by going to Plugins > Plugin Manager in the same way as you installed the QuickMapServices plugin . Once you have the plugin installed you will gain a button on the toolbar which has the tooltip Terrain profile Click on the Terrain Profile button The Profile Tool window should open at the bottom of your screen. The first thing you need to do is select the layer that contains your z or height data. In this case you have two possible layers on your map. Select your gravity surface in the Layers panel - mine is called IDWgrav yours may be something different On the Profile Tool panel click Add Layer under the box on the right - the layer should appear in the box Now check that under Options the Selection is set to Temporary polyline Left-click somewhere on the map on the west of your gravity layer Then double-click (to end the line) somewhere on the east of your gravity layer Immediately a profile should be drawn in the window on the Profile tool panel. Adding a second elevation surface Now try adding the MergedDTM layer too (you may have called it something different). You do it in exactly the same way, except that you already have a line across your map. If you click on the colour patch next to the MergedDTM layer you can change it to a different colour so you can see which profile refers to which data surface. Unfortunately it isn\u2019t possible to edit the y axes independently so that you have the two profiles on different scales.

To do this you can create a feature class and digitise a line across the map . Refer back to the chapter on Creating data by digitising for a reminder of how to do this. Once you have a digitised line Select the line layer in the Layers panel and then use Select Features by Area or Single Click from the toolbar at the top to click on the line and select it (it should turn bright yellow) Open the Profile Graph panel and add your gravity surface as before Under Selection click on Selected polyline or Selected layer The Profile should appear in the window to the left.","title":"Using a feature class for the line on the map"},{"location":"three_d/#saving-the-profile-graph","text":"You can save your profile graph to an image to add to other work It\u2019s a good idea to untick Show Cursor before you save the graph Use the dropdown at the bottom of the profile to select Graph - PNG Then click on the Save as button Navigate to where you want to save the graph and give it a name.

A popular use for this is to extrude building polygons if you have the height of the roof. In this case we\u2019ll extrude the depth of boreholes for this area. At the beginning of this chapter you downloaded borehole data for Llanbedr from Minerva in the form of a csv file. If you haven\u2019t already added this to your map do so now. Remember that you\u2019ll need to add this in the same way that you did the gravity points . Have a look at the attribute table and in particular the LENGTH field - this is the depth of the borehole below ground-level. Now you have the vector layer ready to extrude. Open the Qgis2threejs plugin again. Your borehole layer should be visible in the left-hand menu now. Put a tick in the box next to the layer. You should be able to see a series of spheres above your map. Right-click on the boreholes layer in the Layers list and go to Properties Change the Object type to Cylinder Under Z coordinate change Mode to Relative to \"MergedDTM\" layer (or whatever your DTM layer is called) Under Style you can change the colour and opacity Under the Height box drop down the box and select the HEIGHT field If you click Apply now you should see your points extruded above the map.

Click on this now and enter the following expression. \u201cLENGTH\u201d * -1 Once you\u2019ve done that click OK and then click on OK again. Your cylinders should disappear leaving only a patch on the terrain.

Right-click on the DTM layer in the Layers list and go to Properties Untick Build sides and tick Build frame Click OK Your scene should redraw and you should be able to see all of the points extruded downwards. You can make these more obvious by changing the expression in the properties of the point layer to increase all of them, e.g. by doing * -2 instead of * -1 , but that does make the Mochras Borehole very long indeed!

Important Please be aware that it is essential for this module that you have access to particular GIS software - QGIS. The full instructions are below. Make sure that you have followed these instructions as soon as possible and confirmed that you have access to the software. You will need to start using QGIS in the class in week 7, and will not be able to progress with the exercises without it. If you have problems installing or accessing QGIS for any reason please contact me immediately so that I can help you - c.e.gordon@leeds.ac.uk Installing QGIS on your own computer This is the preferred method of using QGIS. If at all possible you should install it on your own computer as the version in the Virtual Windows Desktop is rather out of date. Instructions for using the Virtual Windows Desktop follow this section just in case you do need to use it. QGIS is Open Source Software which can be downloaded for Windows, Mac and Linux and is freely available from the QGIS web page Which version? QGIS maintains a Long term release (LTR) version as well as the latest version. At the moment the latest is version 3.16.0 and the long term release is version 3.10.11. I would advise that you install the latest version, but you can complete all of the work for this module using the LTR and that is the more stable version. So either are fine. Go to the QGIS Download page and go to the section for your operating system (Windows, macOS or Linux). If you are on Windows download one of the Standalone Installer versions rather than the Network Installer. If your computer is Windows 10 you should download the 64 bit version. Install the appropriate version following the usual method for your operating system, then make sure that you start QGIS to check that it works. If the installation is successful you should be able to see something like the screen below. Let me know if it does or doesn\u2019t work Please email me, Clare Gordon when you have successfully opened QGIS. Also email me if you can\u2019t get it to work. Once you have QGIS working you are set up and ready for the first class. You don\u2019t need to look at or follow the next set of instructions unless you are unable to install QGIS on your own computer. Using QGIS on the Virtual Windows Desktop From April 2020 it is possible to log in to a Virtual Windows Desktop to use QGIS. The Virtual Desktop will run on Windows, Mac and Linux. You need to install a client on your machine for the best access though it is apparently possible to run it in a web browser. Note that QGIS may not necessarily work via a web browser so the desktop client is preferred. Warning Note that the version of QGIS on the VWD is out of date, version 3.6 rather than a minimum of 3.10. Some plugins will not install or run, which will have an effect on completing the exercises for this module. If you are unable to install the software for some reason, this is the best way to access QGIS. Please make sure that you read all of the information in the IT knowledge base article about the Virtual Windows Desktop before you go ahead with this: Direct link to information about downloading and installing the VWD The important things to note are that capacity is limited, so if you can install QGIS on your own computer using the instructions above, please do so. again, capacity is limited, so if you do access QGIS by this route, make sure that you log off the Virtual Desktop when you have finished with it. GIS can very slowly in the Virtual Desktop if your data is on your M: drive. To get around this, copy your data to the Desktop, work on it, then copy it back to either your M: drive, or OneDrive . Data on the Desktop is deleted when you log out of the Virtual Desktop, or are timed out. Warning If you copy your data to the Virtual Desktop it is essential that you remember to then copy it back to either your M: drive or OneDrive before you log out. If you don\u2019t, you will lose the work that you have been doing. I will try to remind you of this at regular intervals during the exercises. When you have installed the virtual desktop client and opened it you should have an icon showing a computer with Academic written underneath. Click on the icon to open the actual desktop. Be patient as it is a bit slow. You\u2019ll be asked to log in with your usual University username and password. Once it has loaded your screen will be filled by a new desktop (your usual one is still there in the background). You\u2019ll need to double-click on an icon labelled AppsAnywhere Portal which opens a list of software Look for QGIS and click on Launch Hopefully QGIS will open, but again, it could be rather slow.
